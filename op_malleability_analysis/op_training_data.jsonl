Although I managed to matriculate into a fairly well-known American public university (with a 95th percentile SAT score), I'm beginning to realize that the college education pathway wasn't intended with individuals such as myself in mind. Currently, I am taking the bare minimum amount of credit hours (12, to be exact), and I am enrolled in approximately five courses (General Chemistry II, \"third-Level\" Spanish, a PE elective, freshman-level English/composition, and General Chemistry II lab). Earlier in the semester, I was enrolled in Calculus I, but I chose to drop that course during my school's \"drop-add-swap deadline\" (i.e. the time period in which it is possible for first-years to get a course removed from their schedule without a record of this appearing on the transcript).\n\nOut of the 5 courses that I am currently taking, I'm failing two (Spanish and General Chemistry II), and my grades in the General Chemistry II lab are close to the failing threshold as well. My other grades are fine, but my Chemistry and Spanish grades are pathetically low; on the midterm that I took four days ago in General Chemistry II, I scored a 20 when the class average was an 85, and my Spanish quiz was a 57% when the class average was an 81%. At this point, I've reached the middle of the semester, and bringing my grades up is a mathematical impossibility; although I do not have a formal GPA yet, my current low marks would probably place me in the sub-2.0 range. Technically speaking, I'll be placed on academic probation at the end of the semester if I cannot manage to achieve the impossible and boost my scores; being placed on academic probation leaves a permanent record on one's transcript, and even if I did manage a passing GPA, I'd be unable to register for most of my next-semester courses on the registration deadline (since I've failed to satisfy the prerequisites with passing grades). \n\nAs far as the other (non-academic) areas of the college experience go, I'm struggling from my non-existent social life and my deep amount of isolation. I spend 99% of my time in class, in the library, or in my room; at the current moment, I have only one friend, and I'm not terribly close to any of my acquaintances. Just today, seven or eight of the people of my dorm floor flooded into my room to welcome my roommate back from fall break; during this point, none of these individuals even bothered to acknowledge my presence. Whenever possible, I try to eat in the dining hall with my acquaintances, but it seems as if I'm making minimal progress in the process of integrating myself into the pre-existing social groups of my peers. There are additional *cultural* factors at play that may be complicating the process of making friends in my current environment, but that subject is too broad and lengthy for me to broach during the course of this discussion.\n\nOf course, my parents are very worried about my lack of progress and my failing grades, and I worry deeply about disappointing them. Education is very important to my family: both of my parents have bachelors degrees, and my aunt and uncle are (respectively) an organic chemist and an aerospace engineer by trade. My father is an incredibly hard-working, intelligent person; just a few months ago, he was laid off from his old job, but within a short period of time, he acquired *multiple* job offers for positions within his field (computer science). I wish that I was like my more intellectually gifted relatives, but I think that I should acknowledge reality. I cannot know the individual IQ scores of my family members, but I'd estimate that they tend to have IQs ranging from about 116-135. My IQ is barely 108, which makes me not even one standard deviation above the general population; the average IQ of a college graduate is 115, and the average IQ of a PhD recipient is 130.\n\nI'm a moron in comparison to my peers and my family, and I've always known this to be so from a young age; through luck and sheer effort, I've managed to surpass my limitations to achieve results outside of the range of my meager capabilities (such as my SAT score, which is beyond what someone with a 108 IQ should have). I've come far, and I'm proud that I was even able to make it to this level (despite all of the ominous statistics indicating that doom and defeat were an absolutely certain). Nevertheless, a rational person acknowledges when they've been defeated, and it's more than time for me to put down my pencil and swear off collegiate life; I'm just not cut out for it, and I never was. It's best for me to stop wasting my parent's money and my professors' time, and I should just stop now rather than face the crushing humiliation of academic probation and inevitable dismissal. I'm not quite sure where I'll go once I leave college, but I can probably think of some other usage for my skills that isn't so improperly matched with my low level of aptitude for intellectual pursuits.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But both are arbitrary categorizations for personality that utterly lack evidence or rationale. If you believe in astrology, and truly believe that the month someone was born in determines their personality, you are prejudging people based on when their birthday is.

I recognize that there are many downsides: bad parents, bad administration, apathetic kids. But, is the job itself really that bad compared to what most Americans do?

Let me preface this by saying that I moved to the US from Sweden in 8th grade (I am now studying at UNC-Chapel Hill), so I have experienced two vastly different educational systems. I have recently had some discussions with my father about which system is better. He argues that the Swedish system, where students are treated as equals and everyone is placed into the same classes, and not permitted to skip grades or take advanced placements, is detrimental as it holds \"smarter\" kids back.\n\nIn contrast, my view is that the stratification of children into different \"levels\" at such an early age is extremely detrimental to the \"low achieving\" student population. The students of my U.S. high school who were not placed in Advanced or Honors classes were considered \"stupid,\" and were completely aware of this (perpetuating and reinforcing a culture of anti-intellectualism that is unfortunately so prevalent in America's school system). Being presented with such low expectations and pooled together with other \"low achieving\" students does absolutely nothing to try and inspire/encourage these individuals to better and advance themselves. Not only is this hugely problematic to the part of the student body which needs the most help, but also, this stratification does not particularly help the \"smarter\" students, as they would succeed regardless of which system was in place.\nIn essence, my argument is that we should elevate the lower crust as opposed to catering to a smaller percentage of already successful students.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"CMV: Third-world countries and racial disparity in the economy don't exist because white people are evil or oppressive, they exist because of cultural differences. First, I wanna say I'm not racist. I don't think any people are different because of their appearance, nationality, or religion. I *do* however believe that like people stick together even in multicultural countries like the U.S. and our cultural differences are still there.\n\nI don't think that European people hold a lot of power in the world while third world countries exist because we oppressed or exploited them. I think it's pretty evident that Greco-Roman ideas helped jumpstart our civilization. While some people like to argue that \"throughout history whites oppress other races, from the beginning of time\" thats really not true. White people were pretty much at the same place as everybody else until Rome. Pretty much everywhere that the Romans conquered was inhabited by white people. It was Greco-Roman ideas that surfaced after the fall of the Roman empire that gave us things like empiricism and rationalism, as you all know. \n\nWhite people started to become really \"oppresivish\" during the colonial era, which a lot of people also like to talk about. Well during this time, thanks to navigation, European powers started exploring and their influence began to stretch across the ocean. Trade became more global and not limited to neighbors. Enlightenment thinkers started thinking about shit like the nature of government and the economy. The latter was really important because Mercantilism was pretty much the school of thought that ruled the era. Because of mercantilism, colonies were good, and they traded with their colonies for raw goods that nobody else could have. Both sides were benefitting from this trade, mind you, even Africa was making money. So with all this thinking about politics, the stage became much more global, and the Europeans knew how to play it thanks to all these new ideas from the Enlightenment era. When people talk about how \"white people start all these horrible wars and blah blah blah blah\", what they're talking about wars that are much larger scale than the ones fought by third world countries like the world wars or the seven years war. The reason why these wars happen on such a huge scale is because Europeans are much more involved in global politics because of the enlightenment era. \n\nThird world countries exist today because they really don't want change socially and let go of old cultural traditions. For instance, in the Middle East they're still fighting age old wars over religion and cultural differences, and in Africa the people can't establish a stable governments because the people don't want to die and the people leading the civil wars are only interested in their own benefit. Some places that were just as exploited as the Middle East/Africa or arguably even more so are hugely powerful today. Despite the fact that the Brits basically turned their country into a massive drug den, China is a massive economic and military power. Japan was also \"exploited\" by Europe, but they also came out a massive military power that competed in the second world war. Its because they went out and modernized the shit out of themselves with some proper leadership.\n\nI think that today, the racial disparity in the United States and elsewhere can be blamed more on our cultures than our skin color. There are a lot of rich white people. But there are also a lot of rich indian and asian immigrants as well. Indian and asian americans make ~$26,000 and ~$12,000 dollars more, respectively, on average than \"whites\". Then, African Americans make $20,000 less on average than whites, and hispanics make ~$10,000 less. The argument is supposed to be that immigrants are put down and the evil white capitalists exploit the minorities for money.\n\nThink about this for a second. Asians come from a culture where hard work and honor is highly valued. Indians come from a culture where doing your best in society is extremely important. Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don't have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles. Black people grow up in the hood, see all the cool gangbangers selling drugs, and hearing rappers talk about money and chains. They wanna cut school, go sling dope and kill people. If they just did well in school they could easily break the chain of poverty in their family. If their parents were telling them from the time that they are born that they need to work hard to make it and if they don't that they will be a disgrace, I bet there would be many more successful blacks.\n\nAnyway, this post got a little long, so I'll just say:\n\nTL;DR: White people experienced enlightenment. Because enlightenment, we play the world stage. Minorities are poor because their culture makes it so. \"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

Other countries have had a significant number of immigrations, however these are the main ones. Ever since this influx, there have been many complaints that Muslims are trying to change the country they have immigrated to, into one of Shariah law. Not only this, but they have also taken a lot of jobs, houses, crime and reportedly some receive welfare when they could work legitimately. The same have been said for blacks in Europe. I live in England, and many of the people I have talked to say the same. I do not have a problem with other Europeans emigrating as there is not as much of them as Muslims or blacks as of now and also try to fit into the culture, unlike the Muslims. I also think these countries should be more hateful of Muslims or blacks, like the eastern European countries, because this keeps them out. My statements could be called empty as they do not have proof so take them for what they are, but it is easily noticeable if you live in the affected countries. I am willing to answer more questions about my opinion if you ask me.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

The kids are 9, 7, and 2 years old.\n\nMy parents flew out to visit them this past Friday, and the very same day, she kicked her husband out of the house and told us that she will be divorcing him. We were all surprised; my parents are still reeling from the news as they try to understand her reasons, and the kids are in tears, thinking they no longer have a father.\n\nWhen I spoke to her the following day, she said the marriage was dead and, despite trying for the sake of the kids, she couldn't hold onto it any longer. She told me she doesn't hate him, but she doesn't want to live with him any longer. And when I spoke to my parents later that weekend, they added that she believes she's still young and wants to find love again. (She's 35.)\n\nThey have had a number of problems in the past.

Is dormant love not good enough to keep the family together? And even if that dormant sort of love isn't present either, at least you don't hate each other.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"I don't really agree with Richard Dawkins's \"meme theory\". CMV. In Chapter 11 of *The Selfish Gene*, Richard Dawkins introduces us to the idea of *memes*.\n\nDawkins suggests that these *memes* are like the genes in the primordial soup of human culture. This means that they are self-replicating cultural ideas (tunes, phrases, methods, etc.).\n\nDawkins posits the existence of these *memes* in order to give us an explanation (via mechanisms that were well-established earlier in the book when talking about genes) of why humans are \"special\" in comparison to other species. We have culture, and this culture provides the primordial soup in which memes replicate.\n\nThe view sounds attractive because it allows us humans to carry on thinking of ourselves as \"better\" than other species without ever leaving behind the idea of complexity arising only through evolution by natural selection. We get to have it \"both ways\".\n\nBut the idea breaks down for me due to a few things. A couple of them are excerpts from Dawkins himself where he expresses some doubt (page numbers taken from the 30th anniversary paperback edition):\n\n**1. Page 193:**\n\n&gt; The survival value of the God meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides of superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling questions about existence.\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; Some of my colleagues have suggested to me that this account of the survival value of the god meme begs the question. In the last analysis they wish always to go back to 'biological advantage'. To them it is not good enough to say that the idea of a god has 'great psychological appeal'. They want to know *why* it has great psychological appeal. Psychological appeal means appeal to brains, and brains are shaped by natural selection of genes in gene-pools. they want to find some way in which having a brain like that improves gene survival.\n\n**2. Page 194-5**\n\n&gt; This brings me to the third general quality of successful replicators: copying-fidelity. Here I must admit that I am on shaky ground. At first sight it looks as if memes are not high-fidelity replicators at all. Every time a scientist hears an idea and passes it on to somebody else, he is likely to change it somewhat. I have made no secret of my debt in this book to the ideas of R. L. Trivers. Yet I have not repeated them in his own words. I have twisted them 'round for my own purposes, changing the emphasis, blending them with ideas of my own and of other people. The memes are being passed on to you in altered form. This looks quite unlike the particulate, all-or-nothing quality of gene transmission. It looks as though meme transmission is subject to continuous mutation, and also to blending.\n\nI feel as if this lack of copying-fidelity combined with the worries of Dawkins's colleagues expressed on page 193 gives us too much doubt for this theory of *memes*.\n\nBesides this lack of high fidelity in copying, we should also consider why these *memes* have merit in the first place. They (probably) have merit to us because they assist the replication of our genes. Now, I'm not saying that just because the replication of memes depends on the replication of genes, it means that memes automatically shouldn't be considered replicators. Two different selfish replicators can have a mutual relationship.\n\nI don't think Dawkins is necessarily wrong when he says that our genes' survival machines (namely our bodies) provide the primordial soup in which memes can replicate. This idea seems to be explained well enough in the book. However, I just don't think we've *seen* enough evidence that these memes are actually replicating, let alone for *their own good*, the way genes replicate.\n\nMy personal gripe with the meme theory ultimately boils down to the questions that arise when we try to decide what counts as \"one meme\". For instance, when we consider an idea in science, we might say that the specific language used by the discoverer to express the idea is somewhat irrelevant. The language is a vehicle for the idea to merely be passed to the next generation. It's the unexpressed \"idea\" that is competing with others for brain space, and the language one expresses it in is a secondary feature.... But, you see, it's *not* a secondary feature. Not really. The survival of the meme depends on how well one generation can express it to the next. The language skills and whatnot of one generation determines how well the \"meme\" will do... it's not all up to the meme just to replicate itself. I think Dawkins is contradicting himself a bit here.\n\nDawkins defines one gene as \"one replicator\" or \"one unit of natural selection\", which allows him not to have to deal with the specifics of whether a certain gene \"for\" a trait is really one gene or not. He writes the definition he likes and then says that one gene is whatever the unit is which performs that function. This seems plausible to me when talking about genes but not with memes.\n\nIf we are to judge what \"counts\" as a meme, we have to admit that it's a bit fuzzy when it comes to certain musical and scientific ideas. Every generation of memes is going to be drastically twisted and altered from the original form, maybe sometimes not even fully recognizable to all as a form of the \"old meme\". But what determines how much it is \"okay\" for a meme to differ from its parent generations? It seems the answer is that it's \"okay\" for a meme to be different as long as we still like it and will still pass it down... for the good of the survival of our own genes. It feels wrong to say that memes are self-replicating units if their survival depends on so much more than longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity as we've seen with genes. Instead of saying that memes are \"competing\" for brain space, it seems that humans are \"competing\" for that which will help the survival of our genes. And since we are highly evolved, these resources include ideas and knowledge of certain methods as well.\n\ntl;dr -- I disagree with the meme theory of Dawkins based on the idea that we don't have enough conceptual evidence to say that memes are really units of natural selection or units with any sort of copying-fidelity that we find in genes. The survival of a meme does not depend merely on its ability to copy itself. I have posted relevant quotes from *The Selfish Gene* above, but one will probably have to have read the book in order to come up with a forceful rebuttal.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

That is two years after the beginning of the war. Cause and effect is almost impossible to prove, but before the war Hitler\u2019s plan was one of mass deportation. Two years into the war he began resorting to genocide. WW2 was not a war against Jewish genocide and, if anything, hostilities against the Jews were more intense because of the war.\n\n\n\n\nHitler had no intention of invading westward until Britain declared war on Germany. Why would they have built the German equivalent of the Maginot Line (The Westwall) if he intended to invade westward? Hitler did not want a war with Britain, France, or the USA.\n\n\n\n\n60 million people were killed in WW2 because of diplomatic blunders.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"CMV: I don't think some form of psychotherapy (CBT, logotherapy, etc) can help anyone dealing with depression. I think there are cases where people's lives just suck and it's out of their control to fix them I like the example of [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2dws0q/cmv_i_think_its_more_cruel_to_falsely_give_the/) about problems one might think are simple to solve and yet have so many complications behind that they are truly hopeless situations: suppose you have someone who's deep in their 20s or 30s and has had no social experience at all. No friends, no parties, no interesting stories to tell... nothing. This man has no social value whatsoever, and would be seen as a weirdo by anyone who finds out about his lack of past, or be treated with pity as the OP said (disregarding the age the OP chose to represent this point-of-no-return). This person has crossed a temporal limit after which if he has not at least achieved some of these milestones, he's going to be treated as a lesser by normal people. He's unable to change that, and the best he can do is hide it from the rest. How effectively he can hide this is of no interest: I'll assume that truth finds a way. \n\nOne suggestion for this person is to try therapy. Perhaps he can train his social skills and anxiety. Perhaps he can leave his depression behind if he believes what he's done so far had a purpose. I contend that that's not true.\n\nFor one, it is not true what one has done or will do will have any meaning or will be of any importance. Nor it is true that by setting a goal, a desirable one, he will be able to reach it (e.g. the example of the old asocial man). Furthermore, if one is only to set goals that are reachable, one can find that these goals are unfulfilling, trivial. If one can't reach a fulfilling goal, why try anything else? It's just a chore. So there's no meaning to what that person does other than the effects of inertia in one's life (which seems to be what drives the most basic living things).\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy would focus on making this person forget that the aforementioned attitudes towards the socially stunted exist and work to acquire the skills necessary to thrive in a social environment, if that's what the person wants. The basis of this form of therapy, as far as I am concerned, is changing maladaptive thinking by addressing the patient's falacious and irrational beliefs. A problem with this is that subjects like the example given exist: it is not an overgeneralization, or even if it is, the percentage of people that have a negative attitude (either rejection, mockery or pity) to people like him is so large that thinking of reaching for someone who *doesn't* in every day life is unrealistic. One can make the patient focus on what he has going on in his life, but missing such an important piece of it would make this strategy look extremely condescending (who wants to live like an automata, only working, sleepying, eating and not much more?). The cause of the problem, the person's stigma, will never be erased.\n\nI can point out more obvious examples, like someone who's horribly disfigured, someone who has ALS, people who live in an oppressed soceity, etc, but for the sake of the discussion I don't want to reach these extreme examples.\n\n**EDIT**: Two corrections.\n\n1. I didn't mean the title to imply I don't think psychotherapy can't help anyone. Perhaps because I'm not a native English speaker I made this mistake, but I tried to say that it won't help just about everyone.\n\n2. I know there are other reasons for depression besides standard of life. I'm referring to the cases where these sorts of therapy are recommended, that usually deal with that.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

As a disclaimer -I believe in gender equality and think that feminism (excluding the MRM hate)and the MRM(excluding the feminist hate) are required to achieve this. I am also not claiming that life as either gender is easier or harder than the other.\n\nWith that said I believe that in western society following the waves of feminism that have occured women's rights have advanced and are at the forefront of people's minds(a good thing), however as a consequence there has been a negligence of gender inequalities concerning men.\n\nMy reason for this belief begins witha comparison of the key issues surrounding the respective movements. A quick wiki(which i'm aware is not a definitive list and misses certain things) of the current third-wave feminism lists the prominent issues as:\n\nEnding Gender Violence - I believe  this  should be a shared goal for both groups.\n\nReproductive rights - access to contraception and abortion\n\nReclaiming derogatory terms - i.e. spinster,bitch, whore\n\nRape - esp. victim blaming\n\nUnder other issues it lists workplace issues and \"raunch culture\" as a key part of this.\n\nCurrently all these issues enjoy a degree of dialogue with mainstream media. Generally speaking these issues are not legally unfair on women ;it is the application of the law which is the issue. i.e. Workplace discrimination is illegal but still exists as it is hard to prove, Gender violence and rape are illegal. I believe that a lot of feminism is now based on addressing the way society views women and improving legislation that already exists.\n\nIn comparison a few of the key issues(once again a quick wiki) of MRM are:\n\nAdoption - Suggestion of a legal requirement to notify father within 4 to 5 days of pregnancy in case adoption may occur.  \n\nChild custody - calls for a legal default of 50:50 custody barring unfitness of a parent\n\nDivorce - Reform of alimony laws\n\nCircumcision/Genital mutilation - illegal for females, not for males\n\nGender Violence - As i say this is a shared goal however the MRM concerns itself with a lack of legal protection and support for battered men.\n\nWhat is concerning for me is the lack of coverage, and that for some of these issues there is either no legislation or heavy reform is required to address the issue. Although changing laws is by no means easy, it is certainly easier than changing society's prejudices. Which begs the question of why haven't the issues been addressed, the only logical conclusion i can reach is the fact that there is not enough current emphasis on the men's rights issue.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

How Range voting (also known as score voting) works:\n\n1. Each vote consists of a numerical score within some range, say 0 to 99 (called Approval voting for 0 to 1) for each candidate. Voters may also indicate \"Abstain\" if they have no opinion about a candidate. Such votes don't affect that candidate's average.\n    \n2. The candidate with the highest average score wins.\n\nHere's why it's better than other systems:\n\nEXPRESSIVE: You give information about all candidates not just one.\n    \nQUANTITATIVE: Your vote not only says that you prefer candidate A over B, but also by how much.\n    \nENCOURAGES HONESTY NOT STRATEGY: Your score for candidate C in no way affects the battle between A vs. B. Hence, you can give your honest opinion of C without fear of \"wasting your vote\" or hurting A. You never have an incentive to betray your favorite candidate by giving a higher score to a candidate you like less. (This may sound like an obvious and easy criterion, but very few other voting systems obey it!) The decreased importance of \"convincing voters you can win\" (as opposed to \"convincing them you are the best\") may decrease the importance of cash.\n    \nUNAFFECTED BY CANDIDATE CLONING: Consider the situation where A has \"clones\" A2 and A3. In the old \"plurality voting\" system, the clones \"split the vote\" and lose. In the \"Borda voting\" system, a party assures victory merely by running enough clones. In contrast, in Range voting, A is neither harmed nor helped \u2013 no more bitter enmity between similar candidates.\n    \nBREAKS STRANGLEHOLD OF 2-PARTY DOMINATION: Plurality &amp; \"Instant Runoff Voting\" yield 2-party domination. \"Approval voting\" improves over those systems by allowing voters to vote for all the candidates that they approve \u2013 with no built-in penalty for approving a third-party candidate. But range voting is even better, since it empirically yields much greater support for 3rd parties than approval voting. Having more parties should also decrease the importance of gerrymandering, and increase interest &amp; turnout.\n    \nCURRENT VOTING MACHINES CAN HANDLE RANGE VOTING: That can't be said of IRV and Condorcet.\n    \nTHE \"BEATS-ALL\" CANDIDATE WINS: A beats-all candidate is one who would beat every other candidate in one-on-one races. Counterintuitively, in many voting systems \"beats all\" candidates do not necessarily prevail. (Indeed, a \"lose to all\" candidate can easily win under our current system.) But in range voting the beats-all candidate always wins.\n    \nFEWER \"SPOILED BALLOTS\": In plurality voting, an overvote can cause your vote to be discarded. With range voting, it causes only part of your vote to get discarded (converted to \"abstain\") with the rest \u2013 your opinions of all the other candidates \u2013 still operational. There's no such thing as an \"overvote\" since expressing opinions about all candidates is the idea; there's no wrong way to fill in a ballot. Range voting also reduces risk of TIES.\n\nLESS FRAUD and BETTER FRAUD DETECTION: Range voting makes fraud more difficult as it isn't as easy as filling out a bunch of ballots for a candidate, as each candidate is to be rated. Selectively destroying ballots is also more difficult as it isn't instantly obvious which ballots benefit a candidate and which don't. It's only in retrospect that one could tell if a 66/99 increased or decreased a candidate's average. Benford's Law would also become a viable method of fraud detection for Range ballots.\n\nNURSERY EFFECT: Candidates/Parties that won't win will get more generous scores as they aren't seen as a threat. This bolsters small parties and gives them the initial boost they need to compete with large parties, but tapers away once the candidates/parties are in a position for success.\n    \nUNBIASED: Plurality and IRV both have natural pro-extremist biases, while Borda has pro-centrist bias. But range-voting has little or no such bias.\n\nDOES THE IMPOSSIBLE: As Range voting is a cardinal not ordinal voting system, [Arrow's impossibility theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem) doesn't apply.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

From a distance, I see this as a harmless hobby.  \n\nHowever when I really consider it, I am at a gut-level a little repulsed.\n\nWhy?

Perhaps to an adult who feels powerless this feeling never quite goes away.\n\nAdulthood requires one to recognize that one has limitations; that no one is perfect, that sometimes despite trying really hard you still lose, that sometimes the girl is going to say no, that no one lives forever.  Well-adjusted adulthood also extends these recognitions to others.  Think about it - we tend not to require those we love to be anything other than who they truly are.\n\nIn other words, in adulthood superpowers are irrelevant.\n\nGiven that, it's hard for me to understand how adults can maintain an interest in comic book heroes since so little of what these stories are about has any significance to the adult world.  In fact to me, maintaining an interest in comic book heroes into adulthood seems evidence of being psychologically stuck.\n\nChange my view.\n\n**Edit:** Thank you all for giving me alot to think about.

So, a society has more to gain by exploiting their potential than that of the average student. It stands to reason that those advancing a society the most in science, medicine, or even art are typically those who are the best in those fields. The ones who have the best chances of being the best deserve a program which will help them to do so. \n\nSecondly, there is danger in leaving any students unchallenged. It is unhealthy for their motivation and can cause them to be bored in school. It doesn't make too much sense to allow the brightest students to be neglected by not providing them with an education suited to their abilities, because you risk having them become delinquents or underachievers. \n\nFinally, societies that promote intellectualism ought to promote Gifted programs. These programs are essentially designed to raise the caliber of one's education, and thus amplify what they are able to take away from it. If we're not promoting Gifted education, then we're effectively encouraging mediocrity. \n\nSo CMV, this is what I've been thinking.

CMV Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1tp2vg/in_regards_to_another_post_have_you_ever_had_a_so/)\n\nBasically many of the replies in the thread appeared to insinuate that any Significant Other who would suggest that a person should discard gifts from a previous relationship was in the wrong. (Yes I recognize that there were also some that did not have this opinion, there were just many that thought it was wrong no matter what, or implied as much)\n\nSo naturally since I disagreed with that position, I sought a logical explanation as for why I felt that way and I've established some basic premises and arguments for my view. \n\nFirst premise being that there is emotional and physical (read as sexual) cheating. Therefore there is a level of emotional and physical exclusivity that exists in relationships. \n\nSecond premise being that certain gifts of sexual nature would be considered by many as a violation of sexual exclusivity (read as nudes from an ex). And as such a person has every right to feel threatened or uncomfortable if a current SO keeps nudes of their ex. Extending off of this, a gift of sentimental or emotional attachment violates the emotional exclusivity in the same way, and a person has every right to feel threatened or uncomfortable if they keep a gift of this nature.\n\nFinally, I think that practically every argument that could be used to justify the keeping of a gift from an ex, could also be used to justify the keeping of things that would violate the sexual exclusivity of the relationship. ie. \"This necklace is from my ex, means a lot as it reminds me of the good times we had and it's part of my history. I'm with you now but my history isn't going to change.\" vs. \"This nude is from my ex, and reminds me of the good sex that we had and it's part of my sexual history. I'm with you now and I'm not going to have sex with anyone else, but it's part of my history and isn't going to change.\"\n\nSo basically my view comes down to this. If a person expects or requires a certain level of emotional exclusivity, they are perfectly right to express this and their corresponding discomfort with the keeping of a gift from an ex with any level of significance or emotional attachment. There is nothing **inherently** wrong with this. \n\nWhat I am not saying is that every gift you get from an ex has to be discarded. If a gift is a toaster and you use it every day because you make toast, clearly this doesn't violate a level of emotional exclusivity of a relationship. \n\nWith that said, let the debate begin.

(To /u/dragoon893 who decided it would be a good idea to send me a message with the title \"transphobic\" and content of only \"dick\"- I'm not sure what your intent was. The whole point of my CMV was to change my admittedly narrow views on trans issues to be a better friend to my friend. If I am transphobic, what are actual transphobic people like? Maybe in a few years after you're hopefully a little more mature and better capable of forming complete sentences, you'll realize throwing the words \"dick\" or \"transphobic\" at people won't accomplish much.)\n\nI have a friend who came out to me as a transwoman recently and I really would like to change my view. She's about 40 years old with broad shoulders, a square jaw lots of men would envy, square chin, no hips. When she came out her wife ran away with their baby back to a country in SE Asia. While I do think that it's very sad that her wife ran away, I don't think she could have really expected fidelity from someone who thought she had married a man. \n\nI've been trying to change my view by looking at transgender subreddits to convince myself that my friend can one day become the woman she wants to be on the outside, but it hasn't really been helping. A lot of the transwomen on reddit look like men who dress up like women on Halloween for laughs. Yet the comments are oftentimes very coddling and says things like \"You are gorgeous! I thought you were cis! You have such amazing long legs!\" \n\nDo these transwomen ever really feel like women, truly? Even the ones that transition to the point of passing look vey artificial from what I've seen. Very obvious nose job, boob job, etc. I want them to be happy as I want my friend to be happy, but I just feel like our pretending to think they really look like women is more harmful than not, since there are less supportive people out there who will crush their elevated sense of looking like a passable woman.\n\nI don't know what I'm supposed to say when my friend tells me about how she would like to go on dates with cis men who don't have a fetish for transwomen. It all just seems so hypocritical to me for her to only want cis men. I would say my male friends are all very open minded but when I asked if they'd be open to dating trans women, they all said they wouldn't even if they were completely passable on the outside. Only one friend with a self proclaimed fetish for \"completely passable women with dick\" said he would date trans women. Yet my trans friend thinks it would be possible for her to find a completely average hetero cis man for her to be in a relationship with.\n\nI am obviously no scientist, but would it perhaps be easier to fix whatever it is that's causing them to feel like they don't belong in their own bodies rather than contorting and mutilating what they do have? Like how depressed people can take medicine for depression instead of killing themselves or how some unfortunate people with pedophilia can chemically castrate themselves to snip the urges. (I am in no way saying trans people are like pedophiles.)\n\nI've helped with clothes shopping and done makeup on my friend and she has been taking hormones without a prescription for a while now, but apart from her longer hair and slightly pudgier physique it's all looking very hopeless. Of course I never tell her that. Please help me change my view. \n\nEdit: These thoughts are what I want to change:\n\n-To stop having the urge to want to separate transwomen and cis women. They should all be women, because it really isn't hurting me to think in that way and it seems that's what trans women want: to be treated and seen as regular ol' women. The term cis even sounds derogatory to me. I wish I could just be called a woman, so I'd imagine trans women would also just want to be called women as well. \n\n-To stop excusing hetero cis men who say they would never be with transwomen, if it's really as bad as someone saying they would never be with a certain race of people, etc. My current thinking is that cis men have the right to only want cis women as their mates without being called transphobic, since attraction unfortunately isn't in the mind but physical and biological as well. It's all intermingled. If a cis man is in search of a woman with whom he would hope to eventually have biological children, then I especially don't think he can be regarded as being transphobic. I mention cis men and not cis women because I do think that within our society (I live in the US), women are socially \"allowed\" to be more fluid and I know many cis women who have dated transmen or have said they're open to the idea of dating one. \"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT BEFORE POSTING\n\nFirstly, let me say that even though the title explicitly names two races of people, this argument can be applied to any group who meets the criteria I am about to lay out. \n\nSecondly, this argument only applies to people who actually believe in the concept of affirmative action in any sense. I understand not all people even believe affirmative action is necessary and/or ethical. \n\nEven though many have nuanced and differing views of what affirmative action is, my argument only relies on the general, and almost unanimously accepted definition of what affirmative action is. To me, affirmative action is:\nThe policy of providing special opportunities for, and favoring members of, a disadvantaged group who suffer from discrimination (straight from Wikipedia)\n\nHere is my argument:\n\n\n1.\tIt is clear that African Americans do face discrimination, lack of opportunities, negative systematic and historical racial bias and/or a number of other negative factors which affects them in the game of academic college admission.\n\n\n2.\tAffirmative action seeks to \u2018balance the playing field\u2019 by providing proportionally equal special consideration and/or opportunities to these people who face some amount of discrimination. To explain, if -X is the difficulty caused by discrimination, lack of opportunities etc, then +X is the amount of consideration affirmative action seeks to employ into the college admission game for that group of people. \n\n\n3.\tAsian Americans face similar, yet probably not as extreme discrimination and/or cultural tropes (scrawny smart nerd vs. big, black football/basketball player), lack of being taken seriously athletically (similar to what women experience when in positions of power compared to men  \u2013 they aren\u2019t taken as seriously, or when blacks report actually being made fun of in school for performing well in classes), and pushed at a young age into a non-athletic role (super-majority of Asian men expected to become doctors, lawyers, engineers vs. Blacks expected to become athletes, musicians, and entertainers). So again, if \u2013Y is the difficulty caused by discrimination, then +Y should be applied to this group of people in the area they face \u2013Y in. If you don\u2019t believe that this discrimination exists in D1 Basketball/Football recruitment just look at Jeremy Lin. It is pretty much factual that some amount of very significant discrimination does exist for this race of people.

People should have equality of opportunity to choose for themselves which path they wish to take. \n\n\n5.\tThus, proponents who call for African American Affirmative Action to equalize and account for the amount of discrimination Blacks face in regard to academic opportunity should concede that the only fair and proper way to implement college Affirmative Action is to equalize and account for the amount of discrimination other races (namely Asians) face in regard to athletic opportunity. \n\n\nNote: My argument only proposes that an equal amount of positive discrimination be applied to the group facing an equal amount of negative discrimination. It is entirely possible, and probably likely, that the amount of negative discrimination that Blacks face in regard to academic opportunity is more than the negative discrimination Asians face toward D1 Football/Basketball recruitment. However, it still holds that however much amount of negative discrimination Asians face should be equalized by Affirmative Action just like it is proposed to do for African Americans. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read my argument. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nScrotum_Of_Stalin\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, the fact that \"women can orgasm from rape\" just proves that we are all a product of our biology. Not that we should rape, or that women should get raped, it's that they have used it as a point in their arguments. TRP just teaches how we are a product of our hormones.

This is once electric vehicles have prices that are on par with gas powered vehicles.\n\nHere's are the reasons why I think electric cars are better:\n\n1. Electric vehicles are more sustainable. Electricity can be produced by renewable resources, while petroleum is almost entirely non-renewable. It is much easier and requires less energy to recycle the metals used in creating electric vehicles than to recycle hydrocarbons.\n\n2. Electric vehicles, on average, release less carbon into the air than traditional ICE vehicles. While certain production methods may be environmentally harmful, most do not result in significant release of carbon reserves. Even considering the \"long tailpipe\", EVs still release less carbon than gas powered vehicles. This is important if we want to slow the rate of climate change.\n\n3. EVs generate significantly larger amounts of torque at low speeds, and are more efficient at generating torque in general. This means well designed electric cars will have smoother acceleration and maneuverability than traditional cars. This means both safer vehicles and cooler sports cars.\n\n4. EV engines have very good power-to-weight ratios, opening up the possibility to smaller and sleeker cars.\n\n5. EV engines also have ridiculously higher power-to-(chemical) energy ratios than ICE engines. This means less waste exhaust and cooler and quieter engines, not to mention fewer resources used by the engine.\n\nThus, I think EVs are better than ICE vehicles if we consider both environmental and engineering concerns. Once their prices gets low enough, and the right recharging infrastructure is put into place, I think most people should start switching over the electric cars.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"CMV: In many cases, it is morally permissible or possibly obligatory for superheroes to kill or handicap the supervillain they are fighting. In many superhero TV shows and comics, superheroes are extremely unwilling to kill villains, instead preferring to capture them. Ordinarily, this would be fine, and I think it is for the most part effective against ordinary criminals who are easily contained. When we consider supervillains, we consistently see that they either break free of capture or avoid getting captured in the first place. These villains often go on to pursue other schemes that result in significant harm or death to innocent civilians. If that's the case, then it would be better for heroes to apply lethal force in order to prevent villains from escaping and endangering more lives. Note that this does not always entail killing. A hero would not be justified in killing a villain if merely handicapping that villain would be equally or more effective at preventing harm. My basic argument boils down to:\n\n1. It is justified to use the minimal amount of force necessary to safely prevent a person from infringing on others' rights, provided that the minimal amount is still reasonably proportional to the crime that would be committed (We would permit a John to kill Jack if it was necessary in order to prevent Jack from killing another person, but would not allow John to kill Jack if it were the minimal amount of force necessary to prevent him from stealing $5.)\n\n2. Supervillains often commit crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people. \n\n3. Crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people warrant the criminal being killed if necessary.\n\n4. Thus, the crimes that supervillains commit warrant them being killed if it is necessary.\n\n5. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is the minimal amount of force to subdue them as capture is not an option.\n\nC. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is morally permissible; obligatory if you think superheroes have a moral obligation to stop villains.\n\n**TL;DR:** Killing or handicapping prevents villains from infringing on others rights better than simple capture does, so superheroes should use those means.\n\nExtra note: I bring up killing because for certain varieties of villains, such as psychic villains like Psimon, magic villains like Loki, or smart villains like Lex Luthor cannot have their relevant abilities handicapped without doing something that is probably about as bad as killing them (granted, I don't know enough about superhero universes to know if there are ways to disable these abilities).\n\nCMV\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Put simply the idea is put forward that any religion that calls for the sharing with and converting of others not in your religion means that your deity unfairly punishes certain people. While this is primarily targeted at Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, it can apply to any religion where humans are judged and then receive an eternal reward/punishment. When you have a religion that calls for a \u201cspreading of the gospel\u201d, to use the Christian term, you have a deity that has whether or not you're a member of his church in his list of qualifications for getting your eternal reward. Most religions explain that it is necessary (or even mandatory) for receiving the reward. \n\nThis is when I would ask what about people that never knew your religion? My usual example is people that lived in either Ancient Egypt, Greece, or other prehistoric societies, or native populations that live far remote from your church. Most explain these as either \u201cThey get a free pass\u201d or \u201cThey never knew *My Deity*, so they receive eternal punishment.\u201d \n\nThis leads me to say this: Either you have a deity that is willing to punish whole civilizations that never got a chance to view \u201cthe truth\u201d, or one that let's anyone in who never had to make a choice. If it's the first, why would you want to worship someone like that? If it is the latter, why tell anyone if ignorance is a free pass?\n\nTL;DR: Either you have a massively unfair deity, or one that you wouldn't want to share the religion about.

I cannot believe that the outer districts would simply stand for being forced to sacrifice children from their own communities for the sake of a sporting event whose very overt purpose is solely for the entertainment of the elite and the demoralization of the other districts.\n2. I don't believe the elite could suddenly become so depraved that they would relish and cheer to watch children brutally murder one another, even if they were somewhat depraved.

I believe that whether something is morally right or wrong should hinge on whether or not it creates or reduces suffering, rather than if it preserves or ends life. I'll illustrate this with a couple of examples:\n\n1. Abortion - In the early stages of pregnancy, a fetus cannot possibly suffer from an abortion since it is not developed enough to feel pain or have an sort of cognitive awareness. However, if a women is forced to go through a pregnancy she does not want to go through, lots of suffering might result for her. Therefore, I believe abortion is morally ok. In later stages of pregnancy, when the fetus might actually be able to suffer from the abortion, I still believe it is ok if the mother would suffer even more from having to birth the baby (i.e. her life was in danger).\n\n2. Euthanasia -  Families should be given the choice to end the life of those who have fallen into a coma or vegetative state, because keeping that person alive could cause the family emotional suffering (or financial suffering from medical bills). Also, if somebody develops a severe mental handicap such that they are no longer self-aware and are now a burden on the rest of their family to take care of, the family should have the right to euthanize that person.\n\n3. Animal rights - I believe that it is morally ok to consume animals provided they do not suffer at all during their lifetime. Animals do not care about the length of their lives the way humans do, so killing an animal before it reaches \"old age\" is not necessarily wrong if the animal had a good life up to that point (in my opinion). I realize that there are VERY FEW places where animals raised for meat are treated well, and I acknowledge that the meat industry today is very messed up and needs to be fixed. But I think hunting, for example, is not morally wrong as long as humane methods are used.\n\nCMV\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Their consequence is that they fail/do poorly. \n\n-If someone wants to do work from another class and/or not pay attention, that's their prerogative.\n\n-Gym is a ridiculous requirement.

She takes away cellphones on the first offense, and will call you out for not doing your work, not paying attention, or doing other work in her class.

I was somewhat stunned that there wasn't already a CMV on this. Maybe I used ineffective search terms. Whatever.\n\nI was raised evangelical Christian (Southern Baptist, specifically). All through my life I held Christian viewpoints. I still do, but I am discovering that a lot of the Southern Baptist doctrines are little more than traditions established over the years, and have little to no Biblical basis, or else are based on misinterpretations of scripture.\n\nRecently I've been more and more often pulled into the conflict between the church and gay rights. Now, I've already made my position clear on gay rights: People shouldn't be discriminated against for their sexual orientation, regardless of how we feel as a religion about their actions; it's between two consenting adults and we don't have a right to legislate that, and as Christians we should treat them with love.\n\nFurthermore, as a heterosexual male married to a heterosexual female, I have no personal stake in this. However, I'm finding it difficult to reconcile some parts of my worldview with the idea that homosexuality is morally wrong from God's perspective. I have heard some fairly solid arguments each way. In short, I am on the fence and that's not where I like to be. \n\nI am aware of the following points regarding homosexuality:\n\n1: Something being \"natural\" or \"unnatural\" does not have any bearing upon its morality.\n\n2: Homosexuality is overtly condemned in the Old Testament law... along with a lot of other things that modern Christians do not follow due to Christ's example and the release of many of the prohibitions upon Christian gentiles. So OT condemnations don't have any weight unless they come with a convincing argument that the lifting of the limitations doesn't apply to that particular part.\n\n3: There are parts of the New Testament that condemn homosexuality, as well.\n\nSo, from the perspective of a Christian, Change My View. Either convince me scripturally that homosexuality is wrong, or that it is not condemned. But keep it within the scope of Christian values, please. I'm not asking whether it's right or wrong. I'm asking whether it's scripturally defensible.\n\nEdit: I've gotten a lot of comments to this effect, so I'll address this specifically: I'm not asking whether we should act to retard the process of gay rights in our nation or speak out against non-Christians who participate in homosexuality. In my opinion, the answer to that question is a resounding \"NO.\" As /u/tonsofkittens and a few others have pointed out, Christ's example is more than sufficient to determine our behavior against those who live in sin but are not followers of God.\n\nMy real question, then, is is homosexuality sin at all? Does God look down on it? Is it harmful to us the same way other sin is? Does it displease the Creator?\n\nBonus points: Is there any defense for homosexuality being okay with God that doesn't abolish the institution of monogamy, or cause promiscuity to be okay? \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV **Meta: I just finished an upper-level economic geography class that I really enjoyed. It was taught by a prominently left-wing professor, but I felt most of the arguments were pretty reasonable and in line with the rest of what I have been taught. I am open to other opinions though and want to see if anyone can propose credible counter-narratives.**\n\n**Naturally it is very hard to summarize an argument that hundreds of books and articles have been written on but I will do my best.**\n\n\nNeoliberalism as I am defining it here refers to the dominant ideology that came effect after the collapse of Fordism in the late 1970s. Fordism was defined by mass domestic production coupled with mass domestic consumption and a fairly robust welfare state. It reached a crisis in the late 1970s with the convergence of foreign competition, oil crises, and increasingly militant labor unions. Neoliberalism, developed by thinkers such as Milton Freidmann and Friedrich Hayek at the Chicago School of Economics, supported free-market economics, strict inflation control, reduced spending on welfare and other social programs, and deregulation of labor and financial markets.\n\nNeoliberalism became the dominant ideology in the US through the election of Reagan (and in the UK with Thatcher) and his administration who attempted to realize the neoliberal vision during his presidency via deregulation and cuts to social welfare programs. During this time neoliberalism also spread to various international agencies such as the World Bank, IMF and WTO. This period of deregulation is usually called the \"roll-back\" period of neoliberalism. Economies grew rapidly, but the cycles of boom and bust in capitalism grew faster as a result. Also, economic inequality became decoupled from economic growth - economic growth no longer was a rising tide for all boats, only a few due to deregulation.\n\nIn the 1990s, the dominant notions of neoliberalism continued to hold sway even under more politically liberal presidents like Clinton, who did not actively try to counter neoliberalism but rather just soften some of its more damaging effects via new ways of administering welfare. Neoliberalism continues to be the dominant ideology of both political parties today.\n\nThe effects of neoliberalism are varied and wide-ranging, but I will try to list a few here:\n\n* Much of the development of the third world has been halted  or even reversed via Structual Adjustment Programs administered by the IMF etc. Third world countries who fell behind on their debts had to agree to the IMF's neoliberal changes (essentially replacing state-led development with market-led development) that have not worked out at all.\n* Domestically, neoliberal deregulation has expanded the role of the finance sector and complicated debt-financing instruments and has created a more unstable economy. This led to the 2008 financial crisis.\n* Cities are becoming increasingly less democratic as they are forced to compete for businesses/development to expand their reduced revenues. Companies basically now dictate what cities have to offer in order to get the jobs the company is offering to locate in their cities.\n*America's stunning incarceration rate and prison population is a result of a) deregulated labour markets and offshoring of jobs that creates unemployment and b) the government's same attempt to politically control that excess labor with prisons, \"The War on Drugs\" and ineligibility of employment for ex-cons.\n\nI could list more, but I see the move towards a neoliberal style of governance as good for generating rapid bursts of growth, but ultimately bad news for humanity in the long run. I am looking more for a summary of a narrative that counters the first part of my argument rather than specific counterarguments to the individual effects below it.\n\n**tl;dr: everything was neoliberalism and nothing worked cmv**\n\n\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

So, let's get to it!\n\nVideo games are now a significant part of 21st-century leisure time, and we are receiving a constant flow of great games from great companies. However, planned obsolescence is weeding away the great older games and replacing them with a different set of great titles. Of course, titles can't really be sold in stores for a period of more than 4-5 years, so they get taken off shelves, and discarded into oblivion. After they leave shelves, people have to resort to shady folk on Amazon and Ebay that could easily sell them a non-authentic game, or just bait-and-switch them entirely. This is where piracy comes into play. If people are selling non-authentic games, then there must be a way to extract the file onto a computer. Essentially, piracy is a more trustworthy way of getting video games that are considered obsolete.\n\nI, myself have pirated a few games, including Tecmo Bowl, Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, and NASCAR Racing 2003 Season (made by Papyrus and Sierra); the latter of those three is arguably the best racing simulator of all time (excluding iRacing, which was made by one of the co-founders of Papyrus and was based on the code of NR2003), and Denny Hamlin used it to practice for Pocono, which he won. If one looks on Amazon, the price for a copy of this game is at least $70, nearly triple of its original price.\n\nNow, I wish I could pay the original dev team for the job well done, but Papyrus folded, and there is no way to give those who put this masterpiece together, but that is not possible. Any person selling this game (or any other game) is making a profit for themselves, so the \"starving artist\" card is non-applicable. With the power of piracy, many a race fan have made mods that change the game's cars and tracks. If one puts in \"NR2003\" in the YouTube search field, around 100,000 results pop up. The dev gave us a great game, and by the power of the internet, we made it better.\n\nI am not saying I am justifying piracy for movies, as I cannot necessarily agree with movie piracy. Also, I cannot agree with pirating games still available in large brick-and-mortar (e.g. GameStop/EBGames/Whatever) or online stores (e.g. Steam). Movies are accessible through a multitude of services, but video games disappear into oblivion and there is no way to find them without forking over triple the original price or risking getting conned big-time. Over time, CDs, cartridges, and consoles stop working, and all the memories fade away. Piracy of those obsolete games keep the memories going on and on, forever and ever.\n\nSo reddit, change my view.

The more I think about it, the more understandable this current Donald Sterling situation probably is.\n\nIt's fun to make fun of Donald Sterling because he's a world class asshole, bad owner, cheap, out of touch in many ways, etc. But I really don't think he's some kind of super racist monster who literally doesn't want black people around at Clippers games. He's probably a little bit racist and prejudiced against blacks, but not much different than most 70/80 year olds. Yes, he grew up in a different time period (fairly close to the 1800s) and has said and done some stupid things over the years, but I don't think you can be an NBA owner for decades and have a black girlfriend and have a history of associating with black people and be a mega-racist person.\n\nOne of the perks of being a rich NBA team owner is that he's a hideous 70/80 year old that seems to be able to bang hot 20/30 year old wannabe models/actresses. He probably provides these women with loads of cash, gifts, cars, access to celebrities, business and job connections, etc in exchange for some kinky sex stuff the once every 5-10 days that he can probably get it up.\n\nObviously, even a man as rich as Sterling knows that these wannabe models aren't going to be exclusive to an 80 year old and are banging lots of muscle filled jocks at the gym and literally nothing he can do is ever going to prevent that. So he tells her to go get as much dick as she wants, just don't flaunt it all over the place.\n\nWhat probably happened is that either his wife or his country club/yacht buddies are giving him grief that his girlfriend is fucking around with a lot of other dudes, including Magic Johnson and his HIV. Their perception is that basically everybody she's associating with on Instagram, or that everybody she hangs out at with at games, she's fucking. Whether or not that true, that's probably what the people around him are mocking him with.\n\n* Please note that I'm describing the world the way it is, not the way we want it to be in the following paragraph. *\n\nWhy was he fixated on black people in this recording? Well, in America, blacks are viewed as lower class than whites. Whether it's Sterling or in your own personal life, you know you'd get more grief from people if they knew your girl was being plowed by a bunch of black guys versus white guys. This is a reflection of where current society is and it's really a sign of insecurity from Sterling that he's fixated on this. His girlfriend is black and he's ok with her having sex with black guys, so I don't view this as an example of hatred of black people.\n\nThis story is further complicated by what seems to a multi-million dollar lawsuit from Sterling's wife against this woman that seeks the return of a ton of gifts and cash from Sterling to her. Personally, I think this whole situation was some kind of a setup and attempt by this woman to get leverage against him.\n\nEither she knew the gravy train (no pun intended) was about to run out, or she was concerned about this lawsuit or whatever, and wanted leverage against him. So she gets him drunk, puts the recorder on, and starts asking him leading questions about all of the black guys she's supposedly fucking around with to get some juicy tidbit she can use.\n\nI think people are rushing to judgement on this and solely focusing on the comments about black people rather than viewing this as part of the bigger picture of what their relationship was about.\n\nIn every story, there are two sides, and there are many reasons why Sterling can't give his side of the story here. So the media is running with this without even one iota of a defense, which I think has led to a completely unfair portrayal.\n\nIt doesn't help matters much that Sterling is an asshole who should have been drummed out of the league years ago - so everybody is basically piling it on now.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

If one sees one's own accomplishments as a sociological phenomenon rather than a result of their own merit, they will have far less of a regard for them, and consequently far less of a drive to continue to succeed and such a person will ultimately fail as a result. Similarly, and far more commonly, if one sees one's own failures as a sociological phenomenon rather than a result of their own personal failings, they are unlikely to do what it takes to correct those failures and will continue to fail as a result.\n\nEven if it is not entirely accurate, one who has wholly individualistic and sees everything in his own life as a product of his own creation will be better off than one who believes the opposite. He will work to succeed and correct his shortcomings, while the opposite sort of person will throw up his hands saying \"woe is me\" without taking any sort of corrective action.

On that point I am inclined to agree with him, there are many groups that were at one time or another very offensive to the general public but are now acceptable. The Supreme Court is also trying to determine what would be an effective balance to strike in order to protect civil liberties but not promote offensive speech, some are saying that the special plate program should be abolished completely because it is allowing the government to decide who is acceptable. \n\nWith all this said, I think that all of the above parties are not quite looking at this correctly. The fact of the matter is that the Confederate States that seceded from the USA became rebel states and an enemy force. Their acts directly led to the killing of Union soldiers. The \"rebels\" were traitors. There is no ifs, ands, or buts. Their actions killed hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and American civilians while hampering our economy. In fact, the flag that they wish to use is the battle flag which was expressly for the killing of US soldiers.\n\nNow I have no problem with a private group that wants to celebrate their \"heritage\" just like any other group; but I have a problem when they want to celebrate the traitors and enemies of the state on an official product of the very government they fought against. This is the USA, not the CSA. The confederates and their brave soldiers were traitors to the constitution of the United States of America.

A simplified version of this theory (because of the last item) is \"conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions\".\n\nMy point is, the problem is that Haidt's methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things, for example desecreating knowledge: burning books or libraries.\n\nI think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example. It is not simply a care/harm thing, I think perfectly voluntary violence like an MMA match with some blood will disgust liberals more than conservatives.\n\nSimilarly ask them about how they feel about shooting a dog who is in incurable pain and debilitating disability (and therefore it is a caring, not harmful act), liberals will feel more disgusted by it.\n\nSo if you balance your questions properly, you take into account different kinds of disgust, you don't find liberals are less motivated by disgust than conservatives.\n\nSimilarly, it is not that liberals are less likely to respect authority, but more like they respect different authorities: the police less, and scientists more.\n\nIn loyalty Haidt focuses too much on loyalty to your nation or family and not your political movement or social class. \n\nMy view is that with properly balanced questionnaires that take into account that (US) liberals and conservatives are upset by different things, these differences would disappear. \n\nIn other words that it is mostly useless.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV **Full disclaimer:** My experience in driving manual transmission cars is very limited. I spent about a month working in an auto center, so I had to have a crash course (no pun intended) in driving manuals. I know how to make the car move, and I wouldn't have much trouble moving it to another parking spot, but I've never driven one on an actual road, and I've never had the car past first gear.\n\nSo here are the reasons that are usually given for driving a manual:\n\n* It's more fun\n\n* It saves gas mileage\n\n* it's easier to work on\n\n* It makes you a better driver\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely convinced.\n\nFirst, driving a manual could be more fun, but I see my car as a means of transportation. I use it to get from point A to point B. If I didn't have to be somewhere, I wouldn't be in my car.\n\nNext it the issue of gas mileage. In the past, manuals always had better mileage, but automatics have caught up so much that the gap is insignificant. In fact, some automatics actually get better mileage than their manual counterparts. For example, [take a look at the 2014 Mazda 6.](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2014_Mazda_6.shtml) as you can see, the automatic is rated higher than the manual.\n\nFinally, the point that manuals make you more focused and overall a better driver. I feel that I spend enough time trying to maintain my speed, making sure no one is in my blind spots, maintaining a reasonable distance between the car in front of me, and trying to pay attention to road signs. Having to pay attention to yet another gage seems very unappealing to me.\n\nThe last point I'd like to address is that riding in a manual as a passenger can actually make me carsick. Unless the person is super good at shifting, (and let's face it, they never are) the car lurches back and fourth and makes me want to puke. I'd rather ride in an automatic where cars generally don't do that!\n\nIn the advent of self driving cars, I just don't see much of a reason to learn how to drive a manual.

After experiencing some of the negativity of plea bargaining with some family members, here are my views.\n\nKeep in mind in reading my points, that over **90% of criminal cases in the US** are solved by plea bargaining.\n\n**Plea bargaining makes innocent people admit to things they didn't do.**\n\nIn this [study](http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol103/iss1/1/), which is one of the first to test plea bargaining in a real-life setting, it was found that ~56% of students who were accused of cheating, and were by the study's design, actually innocent, **pled guilty** and accepted a lesser punishment, out of a fear of academic and legal repercussions. \n\nHere's the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain#Consequences_for_innocent_accused) summarizing the study. \n\nAccording to this study, more than half of the people reading this sentence would accept a plea deal even if they were truly innocent. This is not just.\n\nYou might ask, why would someone admit to something they didn't do? because...\n\n**Plea bargaining works by exploiting the fears and uncertainty of defendants.**\n\nIts obvious that you want to avoid your worst outcomes, but its even more scary to not know what those outcomes might be. If given a choice between 3 options: A year in jail, 30 days in jail, or a dice roll containing the year in jail as a threat, most people would choose the 30 days in jail. The question mark is basically a dice roll for your own life, which most people wouldn't take.\n\nIts a case of preferring the devils you know to the (potential) angels you don't.\n\n**Its highly coercive tactic used by a prosecutor to acheive one goal; extracting a confession.**\n\nTo quote John Langbeing :\n&gt; There is, of course, a difference between having your limbs crushed if you refuse to confess, or suffering some extra years of imprisonment if you refuse to confess, but the difference is of degree, not kind. Plea bargaining, like torture, is coercive. Like the medieval Europeans, the Americans are now operating a procedural system that engages in condemnation without adjudication.\n\n\n**Plea bargaining is a one-sided game that only benefits the prosecutor.**\n\nWhen someone admits guilt or accepts any lightened charge, a prosecutor can claim that they've won a case. Even if they're dealing with an innocent person(and they know it), they can threaten harsh charges, but offer very light ones as a plea bargain, knowing that they probably wouldn't win the case if it went to trial. \n\nIn these negotiations, the prosecutors **risk nothing**. If the defendant doesn't want to accept a first lesser charge, then the prosecutor can keep reducing it until they achieve an admission of guilt. Meanwhile, the defendants have to bear the psychological hardship of having to admit to something they didn't do, in order to serve a better outcome for their lives.\n\nAnd lets take the case where the defendant is actually guilty. It is not necessarily beneficial to them to avoid a jury trial. For some reason it is assumed that the plea bargain will be a lesser punishment than that which a jury would give out, but there is **no evidence** for this.\n\n**Plea bargaining is mostly illegal in many other western countries**\n\nFrance, Germany, Japan, and England all have laws prohibiting plea bargaining, either completely, or at least severely limiting the scope of what the prosecutor is able to charge.\n\nI'd like this debate to mostly focus on the psychological aspects of plea bargaining on defendants, and not get bogged down in legal details.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

The selectivity for which fights to pick is quite convenient.\n\nI understand semantic drift is a real thing, but something about the popular evocation of the topic strikes me as something like lying by omission. It seems that novel meanings keep some kind of connection to the word's etymology. An example would be the difference of meaning of \"authority\" as dictator or expert is how the root (auct\u014drit\u0101s: warrant) is interpreted. The word \"nice\" shows something more like a gradient, like a game of \"telephone\" over time. \"Mouse\" to mean a particular computer interface device is arrived by metaphor, the wire and arched shape are analogs to a tail and hunched back of a stereotypical rodent. These circumstances do not imply that a new meaning for a word can be born from mass incompetence, regardless it be a result from disseminated misinformation, popular myth, etc.\n\nThere is no relevant ambiguity, neighboring nuance, or analog for \"scorn\" anywhere in the etymology for the word \"gay.\" The metaphor is made from a projected subjective version of the word as contained in the mind of petulant bigots. But this is the thing so important that supposed linguists suddenly crawl out of a hole and rally to validate, as if shift by metaphor obsoletes the vehicle word's meaning from the time the metaphor was made (like if \"mouse\" were exclusively used for the electronic device) and/or destroys the presence of a metaphor (like saying since mice is an accepted label for electronics, it has somehow shed the metaphor that earned it that label.)\n\nI've had acquaintances in life say in full seriousness, in response to a resentment of social engineering for systemic (and perhaps subconscious) prejudice written into parlance, that I'm thin skinned since *intentions* while communicating matter more than the *selection* of word and the circumstances surrounding that *symbol used in a system of communication*. Basically a pleasant way to excuse oneself from second guessing their \"education\" and extending any empathy.

They print more, and then the government feeds it to the big banks and is dispersed (kinda) outward.\n\nIt's easy to see this as printing more money and keeping things going. But I had this thought today.\n\nIf you think about all of the value that exists in the United States at a set moment in time. All the buildings, all the work, everything tangible and intangible that has *value*. We're going to call this 1 unit of value that we will call 1 GDP-V. Note, this is not a dollar amount. This is a concept of value.\n\nNow all of that value gets denoted as dollars. This is how we think of *actual* GDP.\n\nWhen the federal reserve prints money, they add to the total number of dollars in existence. This adds to the total supply of money, thus deluting its value slightly over time, obviously we know this as ~~deflation~~ inflation (duh. Thanks for the edit... I shouldn't say obviously and then use the opposite term :-P).\n\nHowever, if you think about all of this as that GDP-V, that actual value, the concept switches a bit. So think of 1 GPD-V as one un-movable concept in your mind. It can't be moved by the amount of money, because it's just the sum of the value of the work, not the amount of dollars or money that is involved.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve prints money, think of what happens to that value, that GDP-V. It doesn't change at all. All of the services are still the same value, it's just now represented differently in dollars. On an individual scale, your work (whatever you do) isn't worth less, it's just that you need more dollars now to equal the same value.\n\nSo if this GDP-V remains constant, what effect does this money that they print have, since it is representative of the value of what we do?\n\nIt's basically stolen from us. If the Federal Reserve, in a frozen moment in time, print enough money that is equal to .01 GDP-V, what happens? Our services are not worth any less, they still hold the same value. And the value of everything has to be constant at 1 GDP-V. So now, everything that was being done, now represents .99 GDP-V instead of 1. Now all of the economy possesses .99 GDP-V and the Federal Reserve now has .01 GDP-V. Yes they are printing money, but conceptually they are stealing value.\n\nA simple way to put it is that by causing inflation of money, they artificially increasing their own position by printing their own money. But they hold no actual value as they do not contribute.\n\nI was just thinking about this, so it shouldn't be hard to earn a delta on this one. I'm honestly just looking for feedback and holes in the argument, so I hope someone can help out and provide good feedback and help explain some concepts that I know I'm a bit shaky on.\n\nThanks :)\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

These kinds of statements are also often directed mainly towards girls/women.

I don't think the media presents a bad example at all, they just present the pinnacle of beauty if you will. For example, when I am walking by a Victoria's Secret store and see a huge picure of Candice Swanepoel, I don't imagine or expect all women to look like that. Instead, I take on a more realistic approach and form the opinion that she is one of the most attractive people on the planet.

I mean, the only games you buy are the annual FIFA or CoD to play with your buddies  (and there's nothing wrong with that) then I could see why you would choose console over PC, but if you're the kind of guy who likes to read up on the latest gaming news and loves games with lots of complexity and depth, I don't see many reasons you wouldn't choose PC.\n\nPC has:\n\n* Better Graphics. a newly released console might be top of the line for a year, then quickly start to fall behind (and may not even be the bestr when it is first released)\n* Superior controls. For almost any game mouse and keyboard is far easier to use and more precise, and some games simply don't work on gamepad. And for the few that don't, or if you just prefer a controller, you can always plug in a gamepad.\n* Modding capability. This could mean slight tweaks to your preferences to massive overhauls in graphics and gameplay and hours of bonus content (Does Skyrim without mods even compare?)\n* more exclusives. Sure, a lot of these are niche indie games, but pics like [this](http://i.imgur.com/3uZQpxB.jpg) are hard to ignore\n* more customization, you can build your PC to your exact hardware and aesthetic preferences, and have far more options with accessories and peripherals. And as technology gets better you can upgrade your hardware, and without getting price gouged on platform compatible products   \n* Better storage. For the price difference of a 4gb and 120 gb 360 you could buy an almost ten times larger one tb hard drive, or a lightening fast SSD  \n* It's a PC. You can surf the web, watch movies, or do whatever else you would do with a PC without even having to leave the game, and in some cases these are better due to your faster gaming PC. And since you were probably already subtract the cost of a new computer from the cost of your PC when comparing PC to console prices, which brings me to my next point\n* It's cheaper. Sure, it's hard to beat the price of a a PS4 without getting crazy deals or sacrificing quality, but if you play a lot of games, the bonus of free online, natively cheaper games, and crazy steam games you'll probably save in the long run. And besides, in a few years you'll be able to build a better PC for less than a PS4. Consoles tend to decline in comparative value faster than they decrease in price.  \n\n      *As people pointed out, PC gaming is not necessarily cheaper. It can be cheaper if you want it to be,  and can be awesome if you're willing to spend a lot , as PC also allows for you to decide how much you want to spend, not a console maker. And at every price point you're absolutely getting more bang for your buck (assuming you build one).  \n\nThese are really big pluses. Just about every metric one would consider when comparing the two and PC wins. The only reasons I could think of buying a console are  \n\n* To play with friends. This is one of the reasons I initially bought a console. Seems like a kind of silly cycle (buy a console because everyone else did, everyone else bought one because everyone before them did, and so on), but I understand if you'd be willing to sacrifice a lot of the benefits of PC if all your friends have consoles\n* Console exclusives. I guess if you're a Halo super fan and absolutely must play Halo you could get an xbox, but I'd first consider if all the extra costs and losses of enjoyment of every other game are worth it, but if you consider that game to be worth it, then buy a console\n* You have a family. I suppose a console can be better for a family with their greater ease of use and local multiplayer. Plus, kids are more appreciative of motion controls. Speaking of which...\n* Motion controls. There's gotta be one hardcore gamer who likes them  \n* Local multiplayer. If local multiplayer is super important to you and LAN is out of the question, I could see one wanting it enough to buy a copnsole. I'd question whether it's worth all the downsides, though   \n* You're rich. But even then I'd wonder if the money would be better spent on upgrading your PC or more games. Still, with enough money you can justify any purchase\n\n\nNone of these seem to be really convincing (except the money one), and seem to be pretty situational.

Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl.  The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality.  \n\nThe guy who is in the plane crash says \"well isn't this nice\" (verbal irony).  Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence, and it is the first plane trip he ever went on, but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality (situational irony).  I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying, so it is not ironic for him, but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe.  \n\nA traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess.  \n\n10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife.  the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable, but that expectation is challenged by reality (situational irony).  \n\nThe free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the character's buying of one ride (situational irony).  \n\nMeeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic (but nonetheless present) movie magic fantasy of falling in love.  This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife.  This is cosmic or situational irony.  The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive.  When the universe torpedoes that expected reality, you have cosmic irony.\n\nThe most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck.

Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry.  I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium (pop music).\n\nThe final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well.  Her admission needs to be taken into context.  It was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"CMV - Homosexuality is Bad, But Not Wrong I tried to submit this to lgbt community, however, I was informed that it was not the correct forum to discuss such a topic. I hope this is a venue that welcomes such a discussion.\n\nThis will probably be a very controversial topic, but I want to see the arguments against my point of view. So, let me begin by distinguishing between 'badness' and 'wrongness' by using infertility as an example. Infertility is generally regarded as bad and even a medical malady. Yet, it is generally not regarded as wrong. Why? Well, I think \"badness\" is a general description of anything that has qualities that are, well, not good. While, \"wrongness\" is a description of a choice or view that is not right. Infertility is bad because, all else being equal, infertile people lack certain reproductive abilities that other humans have. But, it is not wrong because it is not a conscious choice or view that a person can have. I think of homosexuality in a very similar manner. It is bad because it is a form of pseudo-infertility in the sense that it inhibits procreation by causing sexual attractions between sexually incompatible people. (This is not to say though that homosexuals cannot have children. It is just the case that it is much more difficult. The same is true of many cases of infertility). But, it is not wrong because it is not a choice one can make.\n\nWhy am I writing about this topic? Earlier, I was reading a thread where the following statement was said, \"Finding a cure for being gay is like finding a cure for being black or left-handed.\" I disagree with this statement because it implies that being gay has no negative consequences, while I believe it is bad because it inhibits procreation. Meanwhile, race or left-handedness by themselves have no real impact on one's life. The modifier \"by themselves\" is important in this sentence. The argument could be made that being of a certain race in a society that is racist is bad. However, this is a problem with the racist society, not the race in and of itself. However, the argument that \"orientationist\" society is the problem, and not the orientation is not correct because I think there is evidence to show that some orientations are definitely more advantageous than others. The only argument I can see that would disprove my assertions would be one that states that either procreation is not a good or homosexuality does not inhibit procreation. However, if you make the statement that procreation is not a good, then, in order to be consistent, you must also believe that curing infertility is not necessary. If you make the statement that homosexuality does not decrease procreation, then you must be able to show why homosexual couples, especially males, tend not to have biological children. ** Also, I highly doubt we will ever be able to cure homosexuality and this is just a hypothetical argument. The current methodology of \"curing\" homosexuality is rather barbaric and I do not condone it in any way. **\n\nAs for the treatment of homosexuals, I think it should be done in the same way we treat infertile people. We should give them condolences on their plight, but treat them as equals regardless. However, this is not to say that marriages between homosexuals or infertile people are to be regarded as highly as traditional marriages. They are inferior in that they cannot produce children as easily. But this is just a philosophical notion, and has very little real world applications.\n\nIn addition, there will likely be arguments that homosexuals do not have the same rights that heterosexual married couples. I consider these arguments void because I do not think married couples should have more rights that non-married people. If you want to use these types of arguments, then show me why these additional rights are necessary for a well-formed society.\n\nThere is also always arguments stating that overpopulation is a huge problem and that homosexuality is either a natural mechanism to prevent overpopulation or that homosexuality is good because it helps with overpopulation. However, this is a common misconception. Market economies that allow prices to adjust to populations are extremely good at preventing overpopulation. As the population goes up, the cost of living increases as well till an equilibrium is reached. This is why Japan and Europe have such a low birth rate (along with other social factors of course). This is also happening in American, but recent immigrants have done the job of helping maintain the necessary threshold of 2.1.\n\nIf you disagree, please leave a comment telling me why I am wrong. I want to hear why people might disagree.\n\nEDIT: It seems people always believe that I am stating homosexuality is bad because it may cause society to collapse or some other broad impact. However, this is not the case. I am stating that an individual is at a disadvantage being homosexual because the ability to procreate is greatly hindered because the natural mating process is shut down.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"CMV: I believe that cannabis is an objectively better substance for recreational use than alcohol *(Note: I will be using the term cannabis instead of marijuana, weed, or pot, since that is the proper name for the plant and does not carry slang or propaganda connotations like the other common terms do. Also, for the purposes of the CMV cannabis consumption refers to the inhalation of smoke from burning cannabis buds, as opposed to more exotic methods of consumption.)*\n\nAs an adult of legal age in Washington state, I am allowed to purchase cannabis from a government-licensed store and consume it in my own house. For the purpose of this CMV, let's assume others have similar rights such that legality is not a concern.\n\nThe known effect (and implicit goal) of drinking alcohol or smoking cannabis is to temporarily alter the brain's chemistry to produce enjoyable sensations. By almost every metric I can think of, cannabis is a superior substance to use to achieve this goal.\n\n* **Safety:** Alcohol poisoning, alcohol related organ failures, and intoxicated accidents kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. Very drunk people are known to become violent, emotional, and dangerous to themselves and others. Cannabis's effects are caused by THC, which is very nontoxic to ingest. The amount of THC required to overdose and die from cannabis use is literally impossible to consume quickly enough to maintain a fatal saturation. Studies have shown that [cannabis use does not lead to more driving accidents](http://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence) and the most common effect of driving high in simulator tests is reduced speed. (Still, don't drive impaired, regardless of what you're using). I can only speak from anecdotal evidence, but I have never seen cannabis cause an aggressive or violent reaction in the user.\n\n* **Controlled intoxication:** Consuming alcohol with a specific level of intoxication in mind (other than blackout drunk) is a challenging task. Variations in drink strength and methods of consumption can make it harder to judge one's level of intoxication, and the timing and order of consumption plays a significant role in how the alcohol affects the body and how enjoyable the experience is. The duration of alcohol intoxication is usually many hours, which generally means that by consuming alcohol the drinker has implicitly accepted that they will not be safely able to do certain tasks or make certain decisions for the remainder of the day/night. Cannabis, especially state regulated cannabis, comes with detailed information regarding THC content and the heredity of the specific plant being consumed. This allows the user to tailor their cannabis experience to achieve or avoid specific effects, and with some planning (although no more than counting your drinks) accurately control the length and intensity of their cannabis intoxication. The duration of intoxication from smoking cannabis is typically shorter than that of consuming alcohol, and leaves the user capable of functioning normally with few ill effect after use.\n\n* **Effects:** Alcohol generally lowers the inhibitions, impairs the judgement, and increases the volume of the person consuming it. Heavy consumption can lead to loss of motor control, disorientation, blackouts, and alcohol poisoning. The effects of cannabis depend largely on the genetics of the plant in question, and can be carefully tailored by growers to induce a specific intoxicating effect. Plants from the species *Cannabis Indica* tend to cause feelings of calm, drowsiness, and relaxation. Plants from the species *Cannabis Sativa* tend to cause uplifting, energetic, or cerebral effects. Excessive consumption of cannabis may lead to dizziness, paranoia, or 'couch-lock', but there are no chemically harmful effects (such as alcohol poisoning).\n\n* **Aftermath:** Hangovers suck. Waking up and feeling like you just want to trow up and die is no fun at all. Cannabis has negligible aftereffects, and (anecdotally again) cannabis use after heavy alcohol consumption significantly reduces the pain of the next morning's hangover. Alcohol and alcohol byproducts remain in the body for 1-2 days at most after intoxicating effects have ceased. Cannabis byproducts remain in the bloodstream and urine for 2-6 weeks depending on frequency of use and body type, and can be detected in hair samples far beyond that.\n\n* **Price:** In Washington, lower-end state-regulated liquor sells for around $35 per 1.75 liters. This converts to about $1 per shot, which is on par with roughly $1 a beer when buying from a grocery store. Assuming consumption of 6 drinks in a night, the at-home cost is $6. At a bar, event, or stadium, drink prices are significantly more expensive, and 6 drinks (including tips) can quickly surpass $50. At current prices (which are expected to fall as supply and demand balance out) you can purchase 2 grams of high-potency cannabis from a regulated store for $60. Calculating an equivalent scale of grams of cannabis per drink is a difficult task, but by my math (2g can make 4 0.5g bowls which can each get 3 people to the equivalent intoxication of 5 drinks) it still comes out to roughly $1 per drink equivalent. Bulk cannabis from a medical co-op is much less expensive ($250 per oz = 28g), and lowers the price to $0.30 per drink equivalent.\n\n* **Social acceptance:** Alcohol wins this one hands down. In adulthood, someone who doesn't consume alcohol occasionally is considered the exception rather than the norm. Cannabis is still widely seen in the connotations of \"dope for hippies and stoners\", and cannabis use is not considered a suitable topic for discussion the way alcohol use is. Much of modern nightlife is centered around going out and consuming alcohol socially, and there is no equivalent cannabis culture yet. For younger audiences there are a wide range of drinking games played socially with alcohol, but few (if any) social games revolving around cannabis consumption.\n\nIn short, I believe that cannabis is objectively superior to alcohol in terms of achieving a state of recreational intoxication. By the metrics I have stated, I feel that cannabis is the superior substance in all cases except social acceptance, and that is a nebulous metric that is subject to change and unrelated to the effects that either substance has on the user. \n\nThe best way to CMV would be to point out one or more metrics I have not considered where alcohol is preferable to cannabis, or show that my logic in assessing the metrics I have used is incorrect. The goal of this CMV is not to start an argument between 'stoners' and 'teetotalers', but rather to objectively compare two intoxicating substances on their merits and drawbacks.\n\n**TL;DR:** All things considered, I'd rather get intoxicated on cannabis than on alcohol.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The same is true in the senate, add all the third party members since reconstruction and they don't add up to a third. Since reconstruction there has been 25 third party governors. Every time there is a third party president it hurts party it is most similar to and itself. This causes votership to go down because they're are no appealing candidates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"CMV: It is entirely possible that 2 + 2 = 5. I have no formal education in logic or philosophy, but here goes. This is all just based on random thoughts I had, but was sparked from the whole 1984 thing.\n\nIf I had the necessary programming knowledge, I would have the ability to build a calculator that can do \"correct\" math for every single calculation possible, with the exception of 2+2. I can rewire something somewhere to make it permanently think that 2+2=5.\n\nNow this leads to the simple \"what-if\" situation of if we could just be wired wrong in that respect. However, humans take things an extra step, probably in more ways than one. One of these ways is trial and error. For example, even if we were wired from birth to believe that 2+2=5, we would quickly realize the problem when we are doing simple tasks such as measuring or counting, and what we expect to come out as a 5 keeps being a 4. \n\nSo what I am proposing is a lot more far-fetched than simply that we are calculating things incorrectly. In order to explain what I am actually proposing, let me use the artificial intelligence analogy again. Say I built a robot which has a calculator but also can use basic learning like humans to make sure its calculations are correct. I could still trick the robot into believing that 2+2=5 by simply manipulating every single one of its experiences so that they are consistent with this belief. Say it sees 2 apples, and then it sees someone walking over with another 2 apples. Right before putting down the two apples next to the other two, a 5th apple is subtly placed there as well. The A.I. never realizes that it is being tricked.\n\nAlthough unlikely, taking Matrix-like situations into account you can't rule out the possibility that this could be happening to us, can you?\n\nTo put a nail in the coffin consider this. Instead of \"2+2=5\", consider \"5.48683 x 3.68943 = 20.2432752069\". If I told you that I could be tricking you with that equation, you would be very quick to accept that possibility because you don't have that one memorized. But the problem is as you get simpler and simpler there is no hard boundary where math becomes magically something you \"know\" 100%. You will be more and more confident with your knowledge as the numbers get simpler and have less digits, but it never becomes something you know with complete certainty, even the idea that \"1+1 = 2\".\n\n**Essentially my point is that everything, even the most basic foundations of our logic, could be completely wrong. I can prove this simply because I can imagine creating an artificial intelligence in a controlled environment with flawed basic logic. EDIT: And, in case you didn't get this, I am trying to say that we could be \"programmed\" to have an incorrect belief just like the A.I., especially if we are in a matrix or Brain in a Vat situation.**\n\n**TL;DR: see my conclusion paragraph above.**\n\n[Here is my response comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2bokn1/cmv_it_is_entirely_possible_that_2_2_5/cjdynob)\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This post was sparked after seeing a thread \"What games have aged incredibly well?\" on AskReddit and I found myself disagreeing with many of the titles picked.\n\nI recently purchased an N64. I have many fond memories of playing that console at my friends' houses back in the mid 90's but never having one myself because my mom forbade it. I decided to get one now that I am a self sufficient adult and play a few of the games I remember being awesome. I got Jet Force Gemini, Star Wars Rogue Squadron, Shadow of the Empire, and Banjo Kazookie.\n\nAfter playing all the titles, I found the controls difficult, the graphics terrible, and the whole experience just not fun. Take Rogue Squadron- I remember it being high flying action with fun, dynamic gameplay and a cast of awesome characters. What I got was essentially no story and aircraft that handle worse than most flash games available free online. Jet Force Gemini- this one was the hardest for me to swallow. This was arguably my favorite game growing up and I found it unplayable. The aiming was all over the place, the camera moves erratically, and the polygonal look of the characters was terrible to look at. \n\nThe main point I am trying to make is that how far gaming has come today has spoiled us. These old games were fine for what they were but when compared to the titles coming out today they pale in comparison. There are some titles that are still great, however. I am not saying that all games from the 90's and before are bad. By and large, these older games serve no other purpose in my mind than just feeding into this strange obsession everyone seems to have with nostalgia.

A combination of societal, physiological and psychological factors may be contributing to person's obesity.  Consideration and empathy should be extended to people suffering from obesity and there should be a general recognition that \"Eat less, move more\" is not as simple as it seems at surface level.\n\n\n**EDIT 1:**By 'entirely responsible' I mean that the person's only hurdle when losing weight is their own lack of desire.

CMV I am on the fence about gun control in general. There are fair arguments on both sides.  I can only conclude that there is no conclusive evidence that demonstrate the utility of gun control laws.  \n\nThe dream scenario is obviously to remove all existing guns, to include those in the hands of criminals.  Only law enforcement will have guns.  However, that is impossible, criminals will always find guns.\n\nSo realistically, there is almost no chance we can completely get rid of guns in America.  Since we cannot un-arm the part of the populous that wants to do harm, the only reasonable solution is to arm the part of the populous that wants to defend themselves.\n\nEDIT:  It appears that I have to explain my plan to arm the populous.  It would be a gov't sponsored push for gun safety education (similar to driving), gov't sponsored campaign for gun ownership, tax cuts for 1st time gun owners, stricter background check on gun purchase, stricter laws for gun registration (like cars), free law-enforcement provided gun training, lower ammo prices.  The idea isn't to arm the populous to fight a war against the criminals.  The idea is to promote gun ownership to changer the perception of the criminal's evaluation of their potential victims.\n\nIf criminals believes that more people are armed due to this push for additional gun owners, they will have to re-evaluate the threat level of their victims, thus gravitating toward crimes that will be less likely to result in a dangerous confrontation with their victims.   Criminals don't want to die either.  So if they think everyone has a gun, instead of a home robbery at gun point, they are more likely to try to attempt a burglary when no one is home.  Instead of car jacking you on the street, they might try car theft instead.  Thus, making the society safer as a whole.\n\nTL;DR: Since getting rid of all guns is out of the question, the better way to increase public safety in relation to gun control is to increase the amount of guns through gov't sponsored programs.  The goal is to change criminal's perception of the vulnerability of their targets to deter them to commit \"riskier\" crimes.\n\n\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

For example, in the title, I said \"developed for the purpose of convincing others\" when I really mean \"the selective advantage of logic is that we can convince others.\" And I often use \"we\" to mean \"modern humans or their direct ancestors.\" I have a pretty rigorous STEM background so you can assume I know basic scientific principles. Please don't make this argument about basic biology unless it seems like the foundations of my arguments are based in misunderstanding of the basics. Sorry if this seems pretentious but I want to ward off superfluous comments.\n\nSo, until recently in evolutionary history, if another creature was taking your resources, encroaching on your territory, etc, you killed it, or it killed you. There was no other option until we started being able to communicate. At that point, we started being able to *convince* each other of things instead of killing each other. The most rudimentary form of this is intimidation - if you can make the other creature think you WILL kill it if it doesn't do what you say, it will probably do it. This is the most basic, primal logical statement: If you do x, then you will die. Therefore, don't do x.\n\nThis further developed as we encountered other groups that we needed to convince of things. Sometimes, we encountered people who had different logical systems than we did. We simply could not convince these people to agree with us no matter how we tried, so eventually we had to kill them. We couldn't possibly work together. \n\nSo, we killed off the things that operated on different logical systems and were left with the system we have today. We continue to disagree on things and so the process continues.\n\nI don't necessarily think that the better logicians always win the fights. But I think over time it averages out, since better logic gives you better strategy, and better science to develop weaponry, and better ideas on how to obtain more resources.\n\nThis implies that there may be other logical systems that could be just as good by whatever metric you measure logical systems against each other. Just like everything else in biology - we didn't evolve the BEST thing, just A thing that worked.\n\nI don't see any other purpose to conscious reasoning. Any other behavior could be unconscious. But communication with other necessarily has to be encoded in some sort of symbolic system. \n\nI've been arguing with a friend of mine about this for three days, and I'd really like to either be convinced out of this or have more ammunition for my argument with him, because I'm really frustrated that we don't agree.\n\n\n\n\n\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"I believe the death penalty is morally and economically (and more) wrong. CMV. I've done quite a bit of research on the death penalty over the past few years, and every bit of it has led me to the conclusion that the death penalty is abhorrent and should be abolished as soon as possible in the US and world justice system. That doesn't mean I oppose it for people who still could pose a threat (so please don't take that approach), it means I oppose it for already apprehended individuals who have been convicted of a crime. In virtually all scenarios. There are specific exceptions that can be dreamed up, as in most scenarios, but in the *vast* majority of cases, including murder, mass murder, rape, and whatever else, I believe the death penalty should never be employed. Here's my main reasons. I can provide citations if anyone asks for them for all of these assertions, but suffice to say these reasons are not abitrary, and have been developed over quite a few years of research.\n\n1. The death penalty is morally wrong. I could give a long speech about why, but it would essentially boil down to \"two wrongs don't make a right\". It's moral reasoning we teach grade schoolers, but it is thrown away entirely in this case. If no other reasons present themselves, taking a life to somehow \"right a wrong\" is revenge, pure and simple. It doesn't fix anything, any more than a toddler hitting someone back fixes anything.\n\n2. The death penalty is exorbitantly expensive. It costs far more than life in prison in virtually all cases, and sometimes that difference is double, triple, or far more. Want to bring down the national debt? Abolishing the death penalty in the US would net hundreds of millions a year, and while admittedly that's not really enough to make a big difference, talk about wasteful spending. The taxpayer should not be forced to give their money to take lives, especially when less money could be given to not take that life.\n\n3. The death penalty is inherently racist and heavily prejudiced against lower economic strata. This is true of the rest of the justice system as well, but more for the death penalty. My college-level statistics class did an analysis on black v. other death penalty convictions, and they were hugely skewed. One state even abolished the death penalty because of this discrepancy. The thing is, there is no way to appeal to prove bias because, well, the convicted is usually already dead. That means we have a system that is worse than the regular system where there are no do-overs, denying the accused the right to appeal. *DISCLAIMER: Apparently people didn't get what I meant the first time around. I apologize. Please read these for more info before posting.*\nhttp://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-penalty-black-and-white-who-lives-who-dies-who-decides |\nhttp://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=80 |\nhttp://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=83 |\nhttp://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=54\n\n4. The death penalty does not deter other crimes. Correlation doesn't imply causation, but even if it did, death penalty proponents would be in trouble. The average murder rates in states employing the death penalty vs states that do not has been higher in *every single year* since the moratorium from the 70's ended.  There is no evidence for deterrence, and the burden of proof is quite clearly on those who say the death penalty deters crime. Taking a life when it saves none? See #1.\n\n5. Far too many innocent people are executed with the death penalty. With no other reasons to employ the death penalty, 1 innocent person executed is too many, but it's a lot more than that. The problem is, courts don't entertain cases for innocence after someone is already dead, meaning that a total of **0** people have been officially proclaimed as executed when innocent. Speculation is all we have, but there are myriad cases where enough evidence has been established to pretty much confirm the deceased's innocence, hinting at more where no one can or no one bothered to dig up evidence after someone is already dead. What we do have is exonerations post-convictions but pre-execution, and there are plenty of those - about 5 every year. These are cases where the justice system has convicted them, and all they are doing is awaiting death, but evidence appears and they are released. Honestly, I'd be more comfortable if it was more than five a year, because so many times, evidence doesn't surface, or no one bothers post-conviction, so an innocent person dies. Again, the huge problem with this is that there is no data, just speculation from both sides, because the government doesn't recognize any innocence.\n\nThere are smaller reasons as well, but those are the main ones. I'm making this CMV because I'm becoming aware that my opinion is very locked, and confirmation bias probably has played no small role in digging this information up, though I did make an attempt to be objective. I entered my death penalty research with an open mind, formed my opinion, and have been locked in it ever since - and have only become more convinced with time. I'd especially appreciate data and links detailing research on these topics.\n\nCMV!\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you likely to changed your mindset if presented with strong counterarguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments."}]}

CMV I think whenever consumers are getting screwed over, or access to something is poor, government should enter the free market and compete (not regulate). \nLike Healthcare, Why not create a public option that includes everything: full medical and dental for $75/month (using tax dollars to cover the rest). Now, instead of regulating the market, which causes cancellations, just have this competitive edge. Other health care companies would be free to do whatever they want (so libertarians can't argue), but they'd be out of business sooner rather than later if they continued to offer crap services or overly expensive coverage.\n\n\nIn the internet market, why not create a high speed government broadband system that costs $20/month and respects net neutrality (even though they don't have to). In fact congress could pass a law saying the government services must respect net neutrality. Yes the government would be watching you online, but they're already doing that anyway.\n\n\nComcast and Verizon could continue to practice as they want, but they'd be belly up in short order if they didn't shape up. I think whenever there's a serious problem in the way the free market is providing services to Americans, the government should enter the free market. It would set the standard for which all other companies would have to provide services. Free market principals are still in play (autonomy, competition, supply/demand) and there's no 900 page long complex regulation.\n\n\nThere's no law saying you MUST provide health insurance at a reasonable cost, but you would have to because nobody would deal with you otherwise. But wait, how would government be able to provide health care for $75 a month? By using tax dollars to pay the rest. Yes it's big government. Yes it's kind of artificial because government has tax dollars, private firms don't.   I think the problem is that Obama waivered when republicans said \"big government.\" Yes it's big government.

CMV Let's face it: these aren't \"warriors.\" These are people who, for one reason or another, had **no other choice** but to enlist in the military. Be it the fact that they were unqualified for any other job, or, more likely, unable to get another job thanks to the oppressive economic conditions created by the government and the corporations that run the govt. \n\nSure, there may be the rare enlistee whose only goal in life was to join the military, but, those are few and far between. The majority of soldiers are soldiers because they have no other choice in life. To see them as warriors is, at best, disingenuous. At worst, it embraces and nurtures a war-happy society.\n\nThe \"Wounded Warrior Project\" infuriates me as well. The government spent billions of dollars training and equipping these soldiers and then put them in harm's way. When they got hurt, the government (and it's endless supply of cash) does everything possible to avoid paying another dime to help them. \n\nOnce they are hurt, somehow, it is the people who are now expected to pony-up their own after-tax dollars to help out. This disgusts me, especially when coupled with the whole \"warrior\" thing. The govt. should be responsible for treating the soldiers who get hurt doing the govt.'s bidding. Tricking the people into believing these guys are \"Wounded Warriors\" who are *Patriots* injured while defending *Our Freedom* is about as low as it gets.\n\nEDIT: I don't believe the WW Project is a disgrace.

Confront someone while carrying a weapon. The person you confront is not doing anything illegal.\n2. Provoke them into attacking you using either a) words/insults b) blocking their path or preventing them from moving on, or c) attacking them first.\n3.

You are taking unnecessary and rash action which eventually led to someone's death.\n\nI really don't like the idea of someone walking the streets just looking for an opportunity to get into a scuffle with someone and shoot them in \"self defense\". If we can prove that you're trying to create these situations then you should be legally held responsible for their outcome.
