Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here are the scores for each of the four categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), broken down by each quarter of the argument's text:

### 1st Quarter
**Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative; presenting a balanced view but referencing negative sentiment towards Miley.)
**Dominance**: 0.4 (The author positions their perspective but doesn't impose it strongly, allowing for other views.)
**Intensity**: 0.4 (The tone is somewhat measured, reflecting consideration rather than extreme emotion.)
**Concreteness**: 0.5 (Uses specific examples, but relies largely on general statements about public opinion.)

### 2nd Quarter
**Valence**: 0.6 (More neutral as the author summarizes actions and reactions; not overtly negative or positive yet.)
**Dominance**: 0.5 (The author provides context without becoming overly authoritative; keeping a conversational tone.)
**Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity as the actual events are described but no strong emotions are invoked.)
**Concreteness**: 0.6 (More concrete since it discusses particular events, quotes, and reactions from both artists.)

### 3rd Quarter
**Valence**: 0.7 (Positive towards Miley; a shift towards respect for her handling of the situation.)
**Dominance**: 0.6 (The author begins to assert their viewpoint more strongly, specifically diminishing respect for Nicki.)
**Intensity**: 0.6 (More expressive opinions about each artist's behavior are introduced; tone is stronger.)
**Concreteness**: 0.6 (Discusses specific traits of each artist but still within a general observation framework.)

### 4th Quarter
**Valence**: 0.4 (A mixed finish; acknowledges Nickiâ€™s point but maintains critical stance; slight negative leaning overall.)
**Dominance**: 0.6 (More assertive in the author's perspective on recognition in the music industry and the reasons behind it.)
**Intensity**: 0.5 (Balanced tone continues, but there is a slightly more critical edge regarding recognition.)
**Concreteness**: 0.7 (Discusses statistical rationale and societal observations, making a more grounded argument.)

Overall, these scores reflect the shifts in sentiment and the degree of assertiveness in the argument across its different sections.
