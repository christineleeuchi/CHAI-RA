Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Sure! Here’s the rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each category (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument:

### First Quarter:
"CMV: Banning someone from a subreddit is absolutely useless, given how easy it is to create a new account. Reddit is a free website that absolutely anyone can use. In fact, it prides itself on the ease at which someone can create an account."

- **Valence:** 0.5 - The overall sentiment is negative toward bans, but it doesn't carry strong emotional weight.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - The speaker asserts a clear opinion about the ineffectiveness of bans.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - The argument presents information in a straightforward manner without extreme emotional heat.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The argument uses factual language but is still somewhat abstract in discussing the ease of account creation.

### Second Quarter:
"So when a mod decides that they need to ban a user, there is nothing stopping that user from creating a new account and rejoining the website. It's like getting kicked out of the bar, putting on one of those shitty glasses/moustache combos from the dollarstore, and strolling right back past the security guard."

- **Valence:** 0.4 - This has a humorous tone but still conveys a dismissive attitude toward the effectiveness of bans.
- **Dominance:** 0.8 - The analogy reinforces the speaker's dominance in this argument, clearly illustrating their point.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - The humorous imagery adds some intensity to the argument, making it more engaging.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - The analogy provides a concrete example that makes the argument relatable.

### Third Quarter:
"Banning someone does not prove a point. If someone did that to me, I would think it to be hilarious."

- **Valence:** 0.5 - The sentiment is relatively neutral to slightly negative; it emphasizes the futility of bans with humor.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The assertion of the futility comes through, but it’s more about personal reflection.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The statement has a light-hearted tone, which makes it less intense.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - “Does not prove a point” is abstract, but the mention of finding it hilarious adds a personal touch.

### Fourth Quarter:
"They got rid of ConstableBobrovsky?, well then say hello to SergeantBobrovsky. You got rid of SergeantBobrovsky?, well then say hello to CaptainBobrovsky."

- **Valence:** 0.4 - This maintains a humorous and dismissive tone, slightly negative regarding the effectiveness of bans.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - There’s a strong emphasis on the ongoing cycle of creating new accounts, reinforcing the argument's strength.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - The humorous repetition adds to the intensity, keeping it lively.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The names create a more tangible example of the argument but remain fictional and metaphorical.

Overall, the argument is lighthearted yet asserts a certain dissatisfaction with the ban process on Reddit, particularly highlighting how easily users can circumvent such bans.
