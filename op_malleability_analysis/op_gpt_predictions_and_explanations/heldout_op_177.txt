Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break the argument into four sections roughly equal in length and evaluate each one accordingly. 

1. **Valence** (positive or negative emotional tone):
   - **Score: 0.7** (The argument has a predominantly negative tone due to the focus on mistreatment and harassment, resonating with feelings of injustice.)

2. **Dominance** (power dynamics or authority within the argument):
   - **Score: 0.6** (The author attempts to assert a strong position by drawing parallels between fat discrimination and racism, indicating a level of authority in their stance, though not in a commanding or authoritarian way.)

3. **Intensity** (strength or forcefulness of expression):
   - **Score: 0.8** (The argument conveys strong feelings about the mistreatment of fat individuals, particularly through analogies, suggesting a high level of intensity in the author's opinions.)

4. **Concreteness** (specificity and clarity of ideas presented):
   - **Score: 0.5** (While there are clear analogies presented, the ideas could benefit from more detailed examples or definitions to enhance clarity and specificity.)

Hereâ€™s how each section would score on these attributes:

1. **First Quarter**: Engages the premise (0.7, 0.6, 0.8, 0.5)
2. **Second Quarter**: Discusses analogies and superiority (0.7, 0.6, 0.8, 0.5)
3. **Third Quarter**: Harassment and inaction (0.7, 0.6, 0.8, 0.5)
4. **Fourth Quarter**: Legal questions and free speech (0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.5)

Overall, the emotional tone is strong and consistently negative, with a solid argument that presents clear analogies, though it could improve in specificity.
