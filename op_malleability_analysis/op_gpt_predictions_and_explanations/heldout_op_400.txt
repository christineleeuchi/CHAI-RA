Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument provided based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it into four quarters and evaluate each aspect accordingly.

**1st Quarter: "CMV: Chopsticks are in no way superior to fork & knife. I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking 'Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery.'"**

- **Valence (0.3):** The sentiment is somewhat negative toward chopsticks, suggesting frustration or dissatisfaction. 
- **Dominance (0.5):** The speaker feels a moderate sense of control in expressing their view but acknowledges the cultural context of chopsticks. 
- **Intensity (0.4):** The intensity is moderate; the speaker is firm in their stance but doesn't exhibit extreme emotion. 
- **Concreteness (0.5):** The argument presents a clear opinion and reasoning, but lacks detailed examples in this quarter.

**2nd Quarter: "Using chopsticks is at best a cultural exercise of contortion. Forks and knives are superior in every way I can imagine & in every situation."**

- **Valence (0.2):** The negativity is more pronounced here, dismissing chopsticks outright as merely cultural rather than functional. 
- **Dominance (0.7):** The speaker portrays a strong sense of authority over their argument, confidently stating that forks and knives are superior.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The intensity increases as the speaker makes a definitive declaration regarding cutlery superiority.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The statement is clear and asserts a particular view but could benefit from further explanation of "every situation."

- **Dominance (0.5):** The writer continues to assert superiority but does so with examples that remain simple and straightforward.
