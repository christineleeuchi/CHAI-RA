Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the specified criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will assess each quarter of the argument separately. 

1. **Valence:**
   - **Score:** 0.8
   - **Justification:** The argument has a positive tone, emphasizing peace and economic interdependence. It suggests that global commerce fosters stability, which is generally seen as a favorable outcome.

2. **Dominance:**
   - **Score:** 0.6
   - **Justification:** The argument presents a clear viewpoint and asserts that global commerce prevents war. However, it acknowledges the possibility of a global market collapse, which diminishes its absolute dominance as an argument.

3. **Intensity:**
   - **Score:** 0.7
   - **Justification:** The argument expresses confidence in the protective nature of global trade against conflict, using strong phrases like "strong insulator." However, it recognizes some uncertainty with the mention of a potential global market collapse, which slightly reduces its intensity.

4. **Concreteness:**
   - **Score:** 0.7
   - **Justification:** The argument provides concrete examples, such as trade ties with China and the benefits of global trade, travel, and communication. However, it remains somewhat abstract by discussing the overall concept of global commerce without delving into specific historical or contemporary case studies.

### Summary of Scores:
- **Valence:** 0.8
- **Dominance:** 0.6
- **Intensity:** 0.7
- **Concreteness:** 0.7
