Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the various aspects of the argument—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I'll break it down into four quarters and provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each aspect.

### Quarter 1:
- **Valence**: 0.5 (The tone is somewhat neutral, but it starts with a positive note on raising the minimum wage before introducing counterarguments.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The argument suggests a strong viewpoint against raising the minimum wage, indicating a preference for price regulation instead.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The language is moderate; while it presents concerns, it doesn't use excessively strong language.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Concepts like "poverty is solved" are somewhat abstract but ground the argument in real-world issues.)

### Quarter 2:
- **Valence**: 0.4 (The tone becomes more critical regarding the potential outcomes of raising the minimum wage, which is a shift towards a more negative viewpoint.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The argument effectively establishes a dominant position against the efficacy of raising the minimum wage while discussing landlords’ power.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The rhetorical questions and concern about rent prices create a stronger emotional appeal.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Specific examples of potential outcomes add a degree of concreteness.)

### Quarter 3:
- **Valence**: 0.5 (There’s a balanced discussion about the effectiveness of market forces for wants versus needs, maintaining a moderate tone.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The argument suggests an alternative solution but doesn't assert it as strongly as previous sections.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The concern over basic necessities keeps the intensity moderated.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The example concerning the Xbox provides a concrete analogy to explain economic principles.)

### Quarter 4:
- **Valence**: 0.3 (This quarter presents a more negative perspective about the implications for skilled labor and socioeconomic mobility.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The argument strongly emphasizes the potential drawbacks for skilled workers, establishing a clear dominant perspective.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The language used—like "rawest deal possible"—conveys a stronger emotional response.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Relevant questions about the impact on those with skills add tangible considerations.)

### Summary of Scores
- **Quarter 1**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 2**: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 3**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 4**: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6

These scores reflect the shifts in tone and argument strength throughout the text, highlighting how the argument develops from presenting an initial viewpoint to outlining various concerns and questions.
