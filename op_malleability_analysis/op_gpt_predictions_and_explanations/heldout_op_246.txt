Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will analyze each quarter of the text. Each rating will be on a scale from 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high).

### Quarter 1: "CMV: Nuclear weapons could end warfare, at least between nation states. If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction!"

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The argument presents a positive perspective on the potential outcome of nuclear arsenals, despite the inherent dangers of such weapons.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion that nuclear weapons can lead to peace, showcasing a level of authority on the subject.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The argument is somewhat intense, especially with the concept of mutually assured destruction, suggesting significant consequences.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (While the idea of nuclear deterrence is concrete, it's based on hypothetical scenarios without firm evidence for universal applicability.)

### Quarter 2: "In the Cold War the USA and USSR both hated each other, but they knew if they went to war nukes would start flying and both sides would be destroyed. The same happened with Pakistan and India, they both hated each other, and fought several wars, but once they both got nukes, they stopped fighting because they knew it wasnâ€™t worth the cost of being nuked."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (The argument acknowledges conflict and animosity but suggests a positive outcome as a result of nuclear deterrence.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The historical references provide a sense of credibility and weight to the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Describing the fear of destruction imparts a high intensity to the argument, emphasizing the stakes involved.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The references to historical events add concrete examples backing the argument, making it more tangible.)

### Quarter 3: "When a nation has nuclear capabilities, no one invades them. If everyone had nuclear capabilities, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (Again, the assertion leans toward a positive outcome but doesn't address potential negative consequences thoroughly.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The statement presents a generalization that assumes uniform behavior among nations, which may come off as somewhat presumptive.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (While the idea of universal deterrence is compelling, the intensity diminishes as the framing becomes more generalized.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (It remains an abstract proposition without specific, immediate historical examples to substantiate it.)

### Quarter 4: "Edit: I never said we should start giving away free nukes to all who want them. We especially don't want our enemies to have nukes, do we?"

- **Valence**: 0.4 (This edit introduces a defensive tone, potentially reflecting a recognition of the controversial nature of the argument.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker asserts control back over the argument but it introduces doubt about the blanket statements made in earlier sections.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The edit appears more subdued and cautious, reducing intensity compared to earlier components.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (It engages with the implications of nuclear proliferation directly, which adds a layer of specificity, albeit speculative.)

By assigning these scores, we can see how each element of the argument differs in its persuasive strength, clarity, and emotional impact.
