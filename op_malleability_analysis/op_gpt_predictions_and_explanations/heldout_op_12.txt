### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV: Nickelback is a really great rock band I know they are universally hated, I know I SHOULD hate them and to all of my friends I have to say that I ironically like them but the truth is, I fucking love them."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Overall positive sentiment despite acknowledging the hate)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Expresses personal preference, but also contrasts societal expectations)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong feelings expressed with "fucking love them")
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Subjective experience, but references universal sentiment)

- **Valence:** 0.9 (Very positive, focusing on the qualities that are enjoyable)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (More descriptive than assertive)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Positive descriptors but less emotional intensity than the first quarter)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Specific details about the music itself)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "I think part of it is that while I am not a dude-bro myself, I fucking love that culture, it makes me laugh, I have fun when I am with them and every single dude-bro I have met fucking LOVES Nickelback. Maybe I am just a dude-bro but am denying it to myself."

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "I dunno. I thought about submitting this question to no stupid questions but felt it would be pushing their limits so I figured I would just ask for help. I don't know if it is possible to stop me enjoying their music but I am willing to talk out reasons I should."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, shows uncertainty)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (More passive and exploratory, less assertive)
