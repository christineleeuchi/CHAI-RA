Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will provide ratings for each of the four quarters of the text. Each rating will be between 0.0 (very low) to 1.0 (very high).

**Quarter 1:**
"CMV: If I ask for no guac, I should be able to get double sour cream for no cost. As I am no fan of guacamole, every time I go to a Taqueria I ask for no guac, and on nachos for instance they will leave out the guac and put sour cream on half of my nachos."

- Valence: 0.7 (Generally positive; the speaker is presenting their preference clearly.)
- Dominance: 0.5 (The argument contains an assertion but is not confrontational.)
- Intensity: 0.6 (The speaker feels strongly about their preference but not passionately.)
- Concreteness: 0.8 (Specific examples like "nachos" and "no guac" provide clear imagery.)

**Quarter 2:**
"Because of this, I have asked for enough sour cream to cover all of my nachos, but every Taqueria I go to wants to charge me extra."

- Valence: 0.5 (Neutral; describing an obstacle rather than expressing a strong opinion.)
- Dominance: 0.6 (Assertive in stating their experience, but not overly dominating.)
- Intensity: 0.5 (Slightly frustrated tone, but overall moderate intensity.)
- Concreteness: 0.7 (Specific scenario is provided, but less detail than the first quarter.)

**Quarter 3:**
"My counterargument to that would be that by ordering a super burrito, nachos, whatever, you are stepping up to the guac and sour cream tier by default, but If I choose to forgo the guacamole and still pay the super nachos price, I am actually saving the Taqueria a small amount of money."

- Valence: 0.6 (Some positive framing about saving money but slightly defensive.)
- Dominance: 0.7 (The speaker is taking control of the argument with a counterargument.)
- Intensity: 0.6 (Moderately intense, focused on reasoning and logic.)
- Concreteness: 0.7 (Uses specific product examples but is somewhat abstract in reasoning.)

**Quarter 4:**
"Why not call it even and say that my extra sour cream is paid for by the guacamole that I did not receive but paid for?"

- Valence: 0.8 (Positive framing; appealing to fairness.)
- Dominance: 0.6 (The speaker makes a compelling point but does not push too hard.)
- Intensity: 0.7 (A more impassioned appeal for fairness, raises stakes slightly.)
- Concreteness: 0.8 (Abruptly clarifies the economic rationale with clear reasoning.)

Overall, this breakdown captures the emotional and logical elements of the argument presented in each quarter of the text.
