Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we'll break it down into quarters and assign scores accordingly.

### Quarter 1: 
"CMV: "Identity politics" is really just a euphemism for pandering to bigotry"
- **Valence (0.3)**: The statement has a negative connotation, as it frames identity politics in a derogatory light. 
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The assertion is bold and presents a clear stance, but it's preliminary and seeks engagement rather than solely asserting authority.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The use of strong words like "pandering" gives the argument a heightened emotional tone.
- **Concreteness (0.2)**: The phrase is abstract and relies heavily on subjective interpretation without supporting evidence.

### Quarter 2: 
"When I hear arguments based in or supporting identity politics, it just has more of a ring to it of group-superiorism or 'two wrongs will make it right' type reasoning than of civil rights movement-style egalitarianism."
- **Valence (0.4)**: The comparison of identity politics to "group-superiorism" and "two wrongs" carries a negative tone, but there's also a hint of reasoned critique.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The argument retains a strong voice and invites consideration of an alternative viewpoint, suggesting an active engagement in the discourse.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The phrasing is evocative, particularly with the contrast set up against "civil rights movement-style egalitarianism."
- **Concreteness (0.3)**: The argument references specific concepts but remains abstract in how it defines and argues these ideas.

### Quarter 3: 
"A real-life example of the phenomenon to which I'm referring is located [here](http://damemagazine.com/2015/04/14/i-am-voting-my-vagina-hillary-clinton-president)."
- **Valence (0.5)**: The reference to a specific case is neutral, serving to illustrate the point without overt judgment; however, the example itself suggests critique.
- **Dominance (0.4)**: This segment serves as a supporting detail rather than an authoritative claim, thus its dominant impact is lower.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The phrase indicates engagement with existing discourse, adding weight to the argument, though it's more factual than emotive.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: Providing a real-life example enhances the specificity and tangible nature of the argument.

### Quarter 4: 
"Please, change my view, if you can, that identity politics of this sort is just a euphemism for a trendy, politically correct style of bigotry."
- **Valence (0.4)**: The request is somewhat open and invites dialogue, softening the overall negative view but still holding onto a critical perspective.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: This segment suggests a willingness to consider other viewpoints, showing an openness in discourse while maintaining a strong stance.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The phrase has a moderate emotional appeal, seeking engagement, but itâ€™s less forceful than earlier segments.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: The plea for others to challenge the view invites practical discussion and real interaction but remains conceptual.
