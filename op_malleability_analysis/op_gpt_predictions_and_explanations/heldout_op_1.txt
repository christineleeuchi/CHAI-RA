Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the following dimensions: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument's text.

### Quarter 1:
*Valence: 0.6* - The argument presents a positive view on the idea of unity, but there are concerns expressed about cultural decay.
*Dominance: 0.7* - The speaker expresses a strong belief in the idea and presents it confidently, suggesting that unification is a logical progression.
*Intensity: 0.5* - The intensity is moderate; the speaker is passionate but not overly aggressive about the perspective.
*Concreteness: 0.4* - It introduces the idea of unification but doesn’t provide concrete examples yet, making it somewhat abstract.

### Quarter 2:
*Valence: 0.5* - This portion is neutral; it discusses historical progression but acknowledges potential conflict with patriotic beliefs, which can diminish positivity.
*Dominance: 0.5* - The speaker’s voice is present but acknowledges opposing viewpoints, which balances their dominant stance.
*Intensity: 0.6* - The use of historical examples provides some intensity, as the speaker seeks to emphasize their point.
*Concreteness: 0.6* - The progression through history gives a clearer framework and makes the argument more concrete.

### Quarter 3:
*Valence: 0.7* - The comparison with the U.S., Russia, and the former UK empire has a positive connotation, suggesting strength in unification.
*Dominance: 0.8* - The speaker uses these examples to assert a dominant position, showing a belief in the strength of larger nations.
*Intensity: 0.6* - There is a passionate engagement with the topic, evidenced by the examples.
*Concreteness: 0.7* - This quarter is more concrete with specific national examples that support the argument.

### Quarter 4:
*Valence: 0.5* - There's a return to a neutral tone as the speaker addresses counterarguments; it acknowledges resistance to the idea.
*Dominance: 0.4* - The acknowledgment of opposing viewpoints lends less dominance to the argument, demonstrating a willingness to engage with criticism.
*Intensity: 0.4* - The intensity drops as the speaker concerns themselves with counterarguments rather than assertive claims.
*Concreteness: 0.5* - This part is somewhat concrete as it addresses potential arguments against unification but lacks detailed exploration of these concerns.
