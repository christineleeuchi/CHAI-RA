Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s a breakdown of the argument using the requested criteria for each quarter of the text:

**Quarter 1:**
*"CMV: I don't think the BlackLivesMatter protester should have interrupted Sanders' rally. However, it makes sense to choose Sanders as the candidate to interrupt, rather than anyone else I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The argument begins with a mild negative sentiment towards the interruption, coupled with a positive assessment of Sanders as a candidate for BLM.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker presents their view against the interruption but acknowledges Sanders’ strengths. There's a balance of power between expressing personal opinion and recognizing Sanders’ potential.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument has a balanced tone, expressing a clear view without strong emotional language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The argument articulates reasons for choosing Sanders but doesn’t provide concrete examples or evidence yet.)

**Quarter 2:**
*"First, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this."*

- **Valence:** 0.6 (This section leans more positive as it emphasizes the strategic choice of Sanders to reduce backlash.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts an opinion about minimizing backlash, demonstrating a clear stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument presents a reasonably intense concern about public perception of BLM, highlighting a strategic rationale.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it presents a logical reasoning process, it still lacks specific evidence or data to substantiate claims.)

**Quarter 3:**
*"Second, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says "Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . ." and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign."*

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive outlook on how the interruption forces Sanders to address important issues.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is affirmatively asserting the potential impact on Sanders’ campaign, indicating a level of authority in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The language becomes more assertive here as the speaker discusses the significant implications for the campaign.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This quarter provides a more concrete outcome of the interruption, analyzing its impact on campaign discourse.)

---

**Quarter 4:**
*"Sanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to [O'Malley's page](https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 (A mixed assessment of Sanders’ stance, less negative than a direct critique but still slightly critical.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This section appears more analytical, with less authoritative force compared to earlier sections.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (This segment maintains moderate intensity but focuses more on analysis than emotional engagement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Here, specific references to policies and the comparison with O'Malley adds a higher level of concreteness to the argument.)
