Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the provided categories of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will rate each quarter of the text from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:**
"CMV: Tipping is a powerful economic force that improves service when properly applied I see many CMVs suggesting that tipping is bad, but growing up in a city that lives on tips and embraces tipping, I have a different view. Is my view unique to my community? Is it wrong?"

**Valence:** 0.7 - The tone is generally positive toward tipping as an economic force but acknowledges opposing views.
**Dominance:** 0.6 - The author asserts their perspective strongly, indicating confidence in their experiences but also invites discussion.
**Intensity:** 0.5 - The emotional weight is moderate; it expresses a personal connection to the topic but stays mostly factual.
**Concreteness:** 0.4 - The argument begins introducing personal experience but lacks detailed examples at this stage.

### Quarter 2:
**Text:**
"I grew up in Las Vegas where most service industry jobs both allow tipping and reward tippers with excellent service. Poor tippers quickly find that their behavior will result in poor service."

**Valence:** 0.8 - The positive nature of the relationship between tipping and service quality is well expressed.
**Dominance:** 0.7 - The author establishes a strong assertion about the norms in Las Vegas, presenting their view as widely accepted within that context.
**Intensity:** 0.6 - The statement evokes some emotion regarding fairness tied to tipping behavior.
**Concreteness:** 0.7 - This section provides a clearer personal context and observable consequences of tipping.

### Quarter 3:
**Text:**
"For example, casinos have cocktail servers who patrol the casino bringing drinks to players. When the server brings your first drink, you should tip them something (usually at least a dollar). If you tip average or above average, the server will return in a few moments to check on you and bring another drink if you need it. If you choose to not tip, you will likely wait much longer before you see your server again."

**Valence:** 0.9 - This passage strongly emphasizes the benefits of tipping and its immediate impact on service.
**Dominance:** 0.8 - The argument is assertive and presents tipping as not just customary but necessary for enhanced service.
**Intensity:** 0.7 - The consequences of tipping behavior are highlighted, evoking a sense of urgency to tip appropriately.
**Concreteness:** 0.9 - Provides tangible examples that are easy to visualize and understand regarding the tipping system.

### Quarter 4:
**Text:**
"As to claims of tipping encouraging racism, or female and blond servers getting higher tips, I would say that this is not unique to tipping. Pretty girls get lots of perks while they are young and pretty. No cover charges, free drinks, higher tips, etc. Unfortunately for them, these attributes quickly fade over time. Not having good service skills means their tips will fall off in their 30s or 40s. Again, this is not unique to tipping, this happens in nearly all non technical positions."

**Valence:** 0.4 - This section shifts to a more critical view regarding the drawbacks of tipping, which makes it less positive overall.
**Dominance:** 0.5 - The author acknowledges a counterpoint, demonstrating a more balanced view yet still holding firm to their perspective.
**Intensity:** 0.4 - The lack of emotional weight compared to previous sections makes this part feel less intense.
**Concreteness:** 0.6 - While bringing in examples related to societal dynamics, it lacks a direct connection to the tipping practice in detail.
