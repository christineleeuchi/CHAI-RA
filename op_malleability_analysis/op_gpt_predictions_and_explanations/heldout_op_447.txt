- **Dominance: 0.6** (Has a sense of authority based on historical context but not absolute)
- **Intensity: 0.8** (Strong feelings about the unpopularity of the draft and its consequences)
- **Concreteness: 0.7** (References specific historical events like the Vietnam War)

**2nd Quarter (No Close Border Crisis):**
- **Valence: 0.6** (Positive assertion of America's relative safety but implies a negative view of needing a draft)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (Presents a logical argument but does not strongly dominate in its assertion)
- **Intensity: 0.5** (Moderate intensity; it’s a factual statement without strong emotional weight)
- **Concreteness: 0.6** (Uses specific examples of other countries for comparative context)

**3rd Quarter (Nuclear Weapons):**

**4th Quarter (Women, Out of Shape, and Conscientious Objectors):**
- **Valence: 0.6** (Negative towards the practicality of a draft when considering societal health issues)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (Claims a societal reality but doesn't dominate the argument strongly)
- **Intensity: 0.7** (More emotional than the previous sections due to implications of inequality in service)
