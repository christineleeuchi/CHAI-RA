Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, let's define each term briefly and then evaluate each quarter of the argument.

- **Valence** refers to the emotional value associated with the argument (positive or negative).
- **Dominance** indicates the assertiveness or control reflected in the argument.
- **Intensity** measures how strongly the argument expresses its convictions or feelings.
- **Concreteness** assesses how specific and detailed the argument is.

Now, let's break down the argument into four quarters and provide ratings for each aspect.

### Quarter 1
"CMV: Bringing your kids to church is indoctrination and they shouldn't be allowed in any church until they reach an age where they can decide for themselves. Disclaimer: I am very anti-theist so that's why I have such a negative thought of bringing your kids to church."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (negative viewpoint, strong anti-theist sentiment)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (assertive opinion with a clear stance against a common practice)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (strong emotional conviction expressed)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (presents a clear opinion but lacks detailed rationale)

### Quarter 2
"Bringing children to church starting at a young age is very likely to make that person blindly follow that religion without them having much of a choice. At a young age, kids are impressionable and tend to believe whatever an adult/parent says to them. Thus, the odds of them changing their beliefs are lowered."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (still negative, but presents reasoning that softens the emotional stance slightly)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (a firm assertion about the impact of early exposure to religion)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (strong yet rational argument, conveying concern)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (provides specific reasoning about children’s impressionability)

### Quarter 3
"I am not saying that they will never switch, it's just the odds of them doing so are severely lowered."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (a moderate stance, attempting to mitigate the earlier negativity)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (more neutral—softer dominance)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (lower intensity, more nuanced)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (specific about the potential for belief change)

### Quarter 4
"I believe that any church or religious meeting areas should have an age restriction (I will leave that age number up for debate). And not to make them not believe in religion, that violates the constitution. But to let them make the choice themselves, and purely by themselves. I know that the parents could just teach them about it, but hey, if some people are going to indoctrinate their child, might as well make them use their own time to do that."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (negative connotation regarding indoctrination but also allows for open discussion)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (asserts a proposed change, allowing for debate indicates openness)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (fairly strong conclusion—the proposed age restriction)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (presents a specific proposal, indicating practical implications)

### Summary of Ratings
#### Quarter 1:
- Valence: 0.2
- Dominance: 0.8
- Intensity: 0.7
- Concreteness: 0.5
