To evaluate the argument based on the specified metrics (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), we can break it down into four quarters and assign scores accordingly. Here's the assessment:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: We do not have to fear automation They've been saying this since the 30s."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive, as it asserts a lack of fear regarding automation)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (A confident stance is taken, suggesting authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; the statement is declarative but not overly forceful)
- **Concreteness:** 0.3 (Fairly abstract concept with a historical reference, lacks specifics)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, instead we are working longer hours than ever."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Somewhat negative aspect introduced by the contradiction with Keynes’s prediction)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Neutral, presents a historical perspective rather than asserting dominance)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate, as it reflects frustration with current work hours)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Fairly concrete due to reference to work hours, but still somewhat abstract in proposition)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "There's no reason to think this will change anytime soon, if it hasn't in the last 80 years."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, implying resignation rather than a strong positive or negative stance)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (A commanding prediction about the future)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; suggests a certainty about future trends)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Somewhat concrete with specific timeframe, yet still abstract regarding specific changes)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "People were saying from the 18th Century that the industrial revolution will make man redundant? But did it? People moved on, new types of job openings which we'd never have imagined before came to be, think about the luddites' opposition to technology. We do not have anything to fear."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive, emphasizing adaptation and progress)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly asserts that progress prevails over fear)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity; very emphatic in concluding that there’s nothing to fear)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concrete historical examples are provided)
