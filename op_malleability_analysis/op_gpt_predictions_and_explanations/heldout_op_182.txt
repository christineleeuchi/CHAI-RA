Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument you provided on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll analyze each quarter of the argument. 

### Quarter 1: 
**Text Excerpt:** "CMV: It is completely OK to not have any interest in the 2015 Women's World Cup if you're a fan of men's football/soccer..."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral stance, accepting the validity of different preferences)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker is not positioning themselves as authoritative but rather presenting an opinion)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The language is mild and not particularly charged)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific reference to the Women's World Cup provides some grounding)

### Quarter 2:
**Text Excerpt:** "I was having a conversation with a friend who is a fan of both the US National Team and the US Women's National Team..."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Continues the neutral tone, but introduces an argument against the author's position)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author discusses their viewpoint in relation to others, a bit more assertive)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Some emotional engagement as it relates to personal opinions)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (References a personal interaction but remains somewhat vague)

### Quarter 3:
**Text Excerpt:** "While I am all for growing the sport of football/soccer in the United States, I just cannot care if the sport has success on the women's side..."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (More negative towards the women's side of the sport)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The author is clearly stating their position with assertiveness)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Stronger sentiment, especially with the claim of inferiority)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Mentions specific events for backup, but overall feels more subjective)

### Quarter 4:
**Text Excerpt:** "I am by no means saying that young girls shouldn't go out to watch the Women's World Cup if they feel compelled to..."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (A more balanced view acknowledging the potential positive aspects of the women's game)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Less dominant as itâ€™s more about acceptance than asserting an opinion)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Milder tone, attempting to soften the prior harshness)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Refers to female role models but stays abstract in the argument)
