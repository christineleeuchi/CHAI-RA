Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here's a breakdown of the ratings for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**Quarter 1: "CMV:The Electoral College Should be Abolished I believe the electoral college was established at a time when much fewer people voted, fewer people had basic educations, and voting only took place in 13 states, leaving the possibility of a single large state (Virginia) dominating the election very possible."**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (The sentiment is mostly negative towards the Electoral College.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The claim is assertive but does not overly dominate the discourse.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument implies strong feelings regarding the outdated nature of the Electoral College.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Uses historical context to frame the argument, making it easier to visualize.)

**Quarter 2: "We live in a very different time now, and a popular election would be the best way to elect a president, as many people's votes simply don't count in our current system."**
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive sentiment toward the popular vote.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Offers a strong perspective but remains open to discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Conveys strong belief in the necessity of change.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Presents a clear proposal for change.)

**Quarter 3: "Our current system does not encourage voter turnout when you are in a clear minority. Conservatives in California and liberals in Alabama both have no real reason to go vote on election day."**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Focuses on negative aspects of the current system.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The assertion about voter turnout is relevant but not overly forceful.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strongly critiques the current voter motivation.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Real-world examples make the argument more relatable and understandable.)

**Quarter 4: "A popular vote would ensure every vote counts, and would even give independent and third party candidates a real chance fair shot at the presidency, where they don't now. So what say you? Show me the errors of my ways, and convince me that the electoral college really is the best and most fair way to choose the president."**
- **Valence:** 0.9 (Highly positive sentiment about the implications of a popular vote.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Challenges the opposing view but invites dialogue.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (Strongly emphasizes the inclusivity of a popular vote.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Offers a clear argument but is slightly abstract when discussing the implications for third-party candidates.)

Overall, this argument is articulated with a significant degree of clarity and conviction, particularly in advocating for the abolishment of the Electoral College and the benefits of a popular vote.
