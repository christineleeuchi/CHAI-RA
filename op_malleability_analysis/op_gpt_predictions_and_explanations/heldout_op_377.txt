Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the four dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—for each quarter of the provided argument, I will use the following definitions:

- **Valence**: The intrinsic attractiveness or aversiveness of a situation or idea (positive vs negative).
- **Dominance**: The level of control or influence the argument asserts (strong vs weak).
- **Intensity**: The strength or passion expressed in the argument (high vs low).
- **Concreteness**: The degree to which the argument uses specific examples or terms (concrete vs abstract).

### Quarter 1: "CMV:CMV:Situations where the world will end due to an Artificial intelligence or Super Technology will never happen."
- **Valence**: 1.0 (very positive outlook, asserting that catastrophic scenarios won’t occur)
- **Dominance**: 1.0 (strongly asserts that the situation described will never happen)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (confident tone but not overly aggressive)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (abstract in nature, as it discusses hypothetical situations)

### Quarter 2: "With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new modern technologies that are being invented are completely beneficial towards society as a whole..."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (still positive, but acknowledges some concern)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (moderately strong influence, refuting pessimistic views)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (expresses a clear contrast but slightly less intense)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (somewhat concrete, mentioning societal benefits with a generalization)

### Quarter 3: "...such as L'Oreal teaming up with Organovo to 3-D print human skin to use in product tests..."
- **Valence**: 1.0 (very positive with a clear beneficial example)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (provides a specific instance that adds strength to the argument)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (strong enthusiasm about technological advancement)
- **Concreteness**: 1.0 (specific example makes it very concrete)

### Quarter 4: "...and NASA announcing a new rover able to make autonomous decision on its next mission to mars. These technologies have no downside and cannot be used with evil/bad intentions (like in the past with nuclear weapons) to lead to a doomsday scenario."
- **Valence**: 1.0 (holding a very positive view of current technologies)
- **Dominance**: 0.9 (strong authority on the subject, invoking the credibility of NASA)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (assertive in the claim of no downsides)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (provides a specific example and contrasts past technologies)

### Summary of Ratings 
1. Quarter 1: Valence 1.0, Dominance 1.0, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.4
2. Quarter 2: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
3. Quarter 3: Valence 1.0, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 1.0
4. Quarter 4: Valence 1.0, Dominance 0.9, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.9
