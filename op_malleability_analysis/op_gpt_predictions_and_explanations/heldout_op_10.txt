Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll assess each quarter of the text provided.

**Quarter 1: "CMV: it makes no sense that the US government allows cars to go so fast Most governments (incl. the US) control the most minute details of cars allowed on their roads (turn signal color, seat belt configuration, fuel efficiency, structural specifications, etc)."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The argument presents a negative view of the current policy but lacks strong emotional language.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It asserts the author's opinion but does not exhibit strong authoritative or commanding language.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The statement is moderately assertive without being overly forceful.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (It provides concrete examples of the regulations on cars, supporting the argument.)

**Quarter 2: "The vast majority of cars go something less than 90 mph at essentially all times, the only exception being criminals (severe and not so severe) and race car drivers."**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This quarter does not elicit strong emotional reactions but emphasizes a negative implication about misuse.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The assertion about the speed of most drivers is confident but not authoritative.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (A clear statement that describes a common behavior, but not strongly charged.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It provides a specific claim about speed and exceptions which is relatable.)

**Quarter 3: "There's no coherent reason that all 100 million light vehicles in the US should be physically capable of driving faster than 90 mph. This useless capability is clearly a risk to everyone on the road and plenty of people near the road, with no obvious benefit to anyone."**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (A stronger negative sentiment is expressed towards the capability of vehicles; it also emphasizes risk without being overly emotional.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The assertion is more assertive, presenting a clear stance against the current regulations.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The phrases "useless capability" and "clearly a risk" convey more urgency and conviction.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument provides a clear rationale about the risks associated with high-speed capabilities.)

**Quarter 4: "EDIT for clarity: this would be for new cars only."**

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This adds a clarifying note without emotional weight.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (It suggests confidence in the proposal but is simply a clarification rather than a stand-alone argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (This is a mild clarification with minimal intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (It's a clear specification of the argument's scope, providing concrete context.)

Overall, this analysis reflects how each quarter of the argument varies across these dimensions.
