To evaluate the argument provided, I'll assign scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text. The scores will range from 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high).

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: The actions taken on gay marriage and the ACA are ultimately more helpful to the GOP than the dems. By the time gay marriage ruling comes in, the GOP will have been helped a lot to win the presidential election. Why? Because these become settled issues."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Somewhat positive viewpoint toward the GOP)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Expresses a clear opinion and perspective)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in the belief that GOP will benefit)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some abstract reasoning, even though it discusses specific issues)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "In my heart, I truly believe there are a lot of republicans who are not racist and homophobic. But they get branded that way by virtue of being part of the GOP. These republicans are now freer to say, let's move on. They can now pivot to other issues. Issues that a broader segment of the population might be favorable to. The Dems have now lost an important rallying issue with gay marriage."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Slightly positive view of some Republicans)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Expresses personal belief but is countered with mention of branding)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, but includes internal conflict)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Mix of concrete and abstract thoughts)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "I worked in politics for years and if theres one thing politicians love, it's an issue they can complain about and do nothing to fix. For the dems, it's campaign finance. For the GOP, it's the ACA. For 18 months, the GOP can talk all about how bad the ACA is and how their plan is better. Or just complain. But they can also throw up their hands and say their hands are partitially tied by the SCOTUS ruling."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral criticism of both parties)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Stronger assertion about political behavior)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Higher intensity due to the nature of political complaints)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concrete experiences and examples from politics)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "By not having to help reach a conclusion to the gay marriage debate and being told by the SCOTUS to give it a rest, GOP presidential candidates are better positioned to win the presidency. CMV"

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive outlook for the GOP)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong opinion on how GOP may benefit)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity in predicting political outcomes)
