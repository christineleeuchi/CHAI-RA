Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide rating scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the argument you presented in the context of the trolley problem, I will break down the argument into four quarters and evaluate each quarter accordingly.

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV: To push the other person off the bridge is the correct solution to the trolley problem. For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the track, and the trolley is coming."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; presents a moral dilemma)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Establishes the scenario, does not assert dominance yet)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate; sets the stage for an ethical dilemma)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear description of the setup)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** "You may either push the other person off the bridge, which will stop the trolley before it hits the 5 people, which will kill that person, or you can do nothing, which will kill the 5 people. I add the rule that the trolley will not stop if it hits you, and will only stop if it hits the person with you, which eliminates the 'I'll jump myself' answer and keeps the idea of the scenario in place."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Still neutral; outlining choices)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Defines rules; conveys authority but focuses on explanation)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Heightens the ethical stakes facing the reader)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very clear explanation of choices involved)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "I believe that the proper solution is to push the person off the bridge. The purpose of the problem is to present a dilemma between utilitarianism (benefitting the most people in the best way) and deontology (doing one's duty in life as in following basic principles), but I do not believe that doing nothing and allowing the 5 people to die is ethical under either mindset."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Leans positive in pushing a solution)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Asserting a strong opinion on the ethical dilemma)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Argumentation intensity increases with the assertion of belief)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Solidifies the author's stance, supporting arguments may need more clarity)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "By neglecting to push the other person off the bridge, you have prioritized your own moral standpoint over the lives of not just one, but 5 other people. The idea that one should not kill may be generally applicable, but to effectively condemn other people to die because you do not want to compromise your morals is incredibly selfish, and goes against the implied deontological principle that one should prioritize the needs of others over one's own (especially if one's needs are really wants). In general, I believe that a failure to take a potentially immoral action to prevent an injustice due to the action being potentially immoral is selfish and unjustifiable."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative towards moral inaction)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strongly dominant argument against inaction)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (Very high intensity, emotional appeal is strong)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While stating strong points, some abstract reasoning may obscure clarity)

### Summary of Scores:
- **1st Quarter:** Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.5 | Intensity: 0.4 | Concreteness: 0.7
- **2nd Quarter:** Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.4 | Intensity: 0.5 | Concreteness: 0.8
- **3rd Quarter:** Valence: 0.6 | Dominance: 0.7 | Intensity: 0.6 | Concreteness: 0.7
- **4th Quarter:** Valence: 0.2 | Dominance: 0.8 | Intensity: 0.9 | Concreteness: 0.6

These scores aim to capture the different nuances of each segment of the argument, with respect to the requested attributes of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.
