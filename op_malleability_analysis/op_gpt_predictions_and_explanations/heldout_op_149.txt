Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument you provided, I'll break it down into four quarters and assign rating scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

**1st Quarter:**
"CMV: In the 21st century western world, both genders have pros and cons and hence one is not more oppressed I know this might be considered a low hanging fruit, and let me know if it is, but I have a friend who is overall very intelligent, yet this is something we argue about once in a while and I was hoping for some opinions that we can read together and come to a conclusion."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral tone; presents a personal opinion without strong positive or negative bias.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker expresses an opinion but does so in a way that seeks discussion rather than asserting authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The argument is mild and non-confrontational in its approach.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The setting of a personal conversation is concrete, but the main argument is still barely introduced.)

**2nd Quarter:**
"Personally I believe that there are issues with treatment of both genders. Women have higher rates of rape outside prison, a very small but statistically significant pay gap (~95:100), stricter standards of beauty, some discrimination in STEM fields in professional environments, general treatment at skill levels, domestic violence rates, sex ed in certain regions, Madonna/Whore complex treatment, etc. I also believe men have issues such as higher rates of workplace injuries and death, PTSD due to higher enlisting rates, treatment towards mental health issues, homelessness, mate selection, physical violence, university enrolment and graduation rates, punishment for the same crime, paternity and divorce issues, etc."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Acknowledges issues for both genders, but highlighting negative aspects gives it a slightly negative tilt.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Presents a well-rounded view but is still assertive in making the point about issues faced by both genders.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The mention of specific issues for both genders adds intensity to the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Concrete examples are provided, making the argument clear and relatable.)

**3rd Quarter:**
"In the end I don't believe that one gender has a clear advantage over the other. I believe that both genders have issues they face in modern society, and to quantify them would take away from the struggles of either. Hence despite agreeing on many points with feminism, I would not be considered a feminist because I don't agree with the core belief that women are the oppressed gender."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Balanced view, neither strongly negative nor positive but presents a distinct position.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts their viewpoint clearly, establishing a stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity as it expresses a strong personal belief.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Arguments are clearer, but there's still a bit of abstraction in discussing the concept of oppression.)

**4th Quarter:**
"This seems to bother my friend who feels strongly about feminism, because despite the fact that we agree on many points, that one distinction is not something we agree on. He finds it insulting that I would compare out-of-prison rapes to something like PTSD from war in terms of statistics of percentage occurring to each gender. Personally I find it shitty because he doesn't acknowledge that men have some serious issues as well, and no one gender is undoubtedly superior in the eyes of society. In many other parts of the world, I agree with him 100%; women are significantly more oppressed in many Islamic countries for example. I just think the only factor in which men are clearly superior in practice and eyes of society are physical abilities, but otherwise both genders deal with some horrible things and no one gender is undoubtedly oppressed."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Some negative feelings are expressed about the disagreement with a friend, but it remains somewhat neutral overall.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It acknowledges a disagreement while affirming the speakerâ€™s perspective.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (This part of the argument has higher intensity as it expresses frustration and conviction about the issues discussed.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Offers examples of social issues and provides context, making it more relatable.)

These scores reflect the nuances present in each part of the argument, considering the tone, assertiveness, emotional weight, and specificity of the content presented.
