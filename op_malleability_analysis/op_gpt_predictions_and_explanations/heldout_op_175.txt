To provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the provided text, I'll break it down appropriately.

### Quarter 1: 
*Argument Establishment*
- **Valence**: 0.3 (Neutral to slightly negative; introduces a controversial topic)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The author establishes their opinion but leaves room for discussion)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate intensity; the topic is serious, but the tone is somewhat academic)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Uses abstract concepts like consent, but attempts to relate them to human behaviors)

### Quarter 2: 
*Vegetarian Example*

- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate; concludes the argument but invites further debate)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Clarifies stance clearly, focuses on a specific aspect in relation to consent)
