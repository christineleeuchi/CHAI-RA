Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will divide the argument into four quarters and evaluate each aspect accordingly.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: The ‘Bathroom Lock’ analogy against Government collection of data is flawed. First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Neutral with a slight negative connotation towards the analogy.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author is asserting their perspective, but not aggressively.)
- **Intensity:** 0.2 (The tone is calm and measured.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The terms used are clear, but the argument is still in its early stages.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Often times someone might make the argument 'if you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about' defending government collection of data. To counter people will bring up the 'bathroom lock' analogy: We all lock the door when we go to the bathroom even though what we're doing is not inherently wrong."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Still neutral but slightly more critical of the rationale for government data collection.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The author introduces their counter-argument clearly.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The argument presents a logical critique but remains calm.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Clear presentation of common arguments and analogies.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "My problem with this is that it is actually arguable that bathroom locks are an analogy in FAVOUR of 'government back doors'. Most bathroom locks are not designed to keep intruders out - they are designed to make sure someone doesn't accidentally walk in on you. But in fact it is common to see in bathroom locks a very simple unlocking mechanism - one that can be unlocked simply by pressing a bobby pin in the hole."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The valence here is balanced as the author explains the rationale behind bathroom locks.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author takes a strong position in favor of their analogy, establishing a clear argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (There is a thoughtful exploration of the analogy, though it’s still relatively moderate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Provides a clear explanation of how bathroom locks work, grounding the analogy in practical terms.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "This is put in place with safety in mind - if something happens to you while you're in the bathroom someone can get in and save you without breaking down the door. I don't know about you, but this is something that comforts me. In the same way that no one wants to see me shit and would only actually use this 'backdoor' through the bathroom lock in emergencies, the government doesn't care about my email to my mom about my sisters birthday, and only actually use collected data when it might be of some help fighting terrorism."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (More positive as it concludes with the comfort of safety and privacy under certain conditions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The author asserts their argument very strongly here, challenging opposing perspectives.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The emotional articulation around comfort lends intensity to the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Concludes with clear parallels between the bathroom lock and government data collection, solidifying the analogy.)

### Summary Ratings:
**Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.2, Concreteness: 0.5  
**Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6  
**Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.7  
**Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8
