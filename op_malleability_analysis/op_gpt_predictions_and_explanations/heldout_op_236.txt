Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here's a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the following dimensions: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the argument in its various quarters.

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV: All atheists are agnostic by default There's a lot of people claiming to be agnostic atheists instead of atheists."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to slightly negative; the claim may evoke resistance)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate assertiveness in declaring a viewpoint)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Average intensity; the statement is straightforward)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The terms "agnostic" and "atheist" are clearly defined concepts)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** "This might have to do with the hateful and condescending views of the vocal minority of atheists."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative connotation; referring to "hateful and condescending views")
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less assertive, as it suggests speculation about motivations)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong emotional weight given the description of a "vocal minority")
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Relatively abstract; relies on perceptions rather than concrete evidence)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "However, I think most if not all atheists are agnostic. If we found undeniable evidence that God exists (e.g. He appears from the sky surrounded by golden light), then most atheists, agnostic or not, will believe that God exists."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; presents a viewpoint without strong negative or positive spin)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Confident assertion about the beliefs of atheists)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity; invokes a hypothetical scenario for emphasis)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (While the scenario is extreme, it effectively illustrates the point)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "In other words, atheists don't believe in God simply because there isn't sufficient evidence. No one is saying with 100% certainty that God doesn't exist."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Neutral to slightly positive; appeals to reason rather than emotion)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Higher assertiveness; clarifies the reasoning behind atheism)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; the points are presented logically)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Clear argumentation presented with rational clarity)

These ratings reflect the tone and implications of each segment of the argument as presented.
