Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break it down into four quarters and provide scores for each category.

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV: I think speed limits are an overall negative force in road safety and are too often used as tools for revenue generation for small towns who unreasonably lower their speed limits to trap motorists into paying fines."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative sentiment about speed limits)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Expresses a personal opinion with moderate authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Strong feelings about the negative aspects)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (General ideas, but includes specific instances of revenue generation)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** "Too often when driving down the road and driving into a small town off of a major route I see speed limits suddenly plummet and invariably a police cruiser is hiding somewhere around the sign."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative; frustration with sudden changes in speed limits)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (More personal experience, adding credibility)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity due to the danger implied)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific examples and scenarios)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "This has caused me several times to nearly get into rear end collisions either by almost hitting someone or almost being hit due to sudden deceleration."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative; personal risk involved)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Increased authority due to personal anecdote)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong emotional reaction tied to safety)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete, specific situations)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "I believe that most speed limits outside specific instances like school zones, residential areas, and signage around sudden hidden turns in the road are unreasonable, and if they were removed motorists would intuitively adjust to a safe driving speed that they feel comfortable with."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed; suggests some limits are reasonable, but overall negative feeling)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Opinion expressed with a hint of authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in argumentation)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Some specifics provided, though more abstract)

### Summary of Scores:
1. First Quarter: Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
2. Second Quarter: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6
3. Third Quarter: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.8
4. Fourth Quarter: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7

These scores reflect the emotional tone, authority, emotional strength, and level of specificity of each part of your argument.
