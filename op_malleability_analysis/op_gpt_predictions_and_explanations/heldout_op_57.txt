Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide the ratings for the argument you presented, I will break down the assessment into four quarters and evaluate each one based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1:
"CMV: Police that infringe on constitutional rights of citizens should get the death penalty for treason. Police take an oath to uphold and enforce our laws, the most important of which are laid out in the constitution."

- **Valence**: 0.1 (The sentiment is very negative as it discusses severe penalties for police actions.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The speaker asserts a strong viewpoint that police should face extreme consequences.)
- **Intensity**: 0.9 (There is a strong emotional charge, given the mention of the death penalty.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The reference to the constitution and oaths provide some concrete basis, but it is framed in a very abstract and serious context.)

### Quarter 2:
"Moreover, they are agents of the state and swore a service to the nation that they serve. Minor mistakes are made by everyone, it is a part of human nature."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (The sentiment softens slightly as it acknowledges human error.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker is still assertive but introduces a slight nuance by recognizing human mistakes.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The emotional charge drops slightly as it discusses the nature of mistakes.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (This section is somewhat abstract and reflects on human nature rather than specific instances.)

### Quarter 3:
"However, police are expected to know in full detail what is laid out in the constitution and what is expected of them is quite clear. If a cop breaks someone's constitutional rights, we can only assume he did so knowingly, thus betraying the nation he swore to serve."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The negativity remains but is contextualized with an expectation of knowledge.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The argument maintains a strong assertiveness about the expectation on police.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The charge remains high as betrayal is a serious accusation.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (There are clear references to the constitution and expectations but still maintains an abstract tone.)

### Quarter 4:
"EDIT: If I can quickly assess a situation with out killing someone or breaking into their house, then a police officer with training should also be able to. There are aggressive people in the world, and we all deal with them without resorting to murder. Just because they're police officers doesn't mean they don't know the difference between what's acceptable and what's not acceptable. It's ridiculous to use 'he had to make a quick decision' defense."

- **Valence**: 0.1 (The tone remains negative toward police justifying extreme actions.)
- **Dominance**: 0.9 (The speaker is very dominant in their stance against rationalizations for police actions.)
- **Intensity**: 0.9 (The emotional intensity is very high as it challenges common defenses used by police.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The examples provided offer a more concrete view on assessment and behavior, though it also retains an abstract argument.)

### Summary Ratings:
**Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.1 | Dominance: 0.8 | Intensity: 0.9 | Concreteness: 0.7  
**Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.3 | Dominance: 0.5 | Intensity: 0.6 | Concreteness: 0.5  
**Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.2 | Dominance: 0.7 | Intensity: 0.8 | Concreteness: 0.6  
**Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.1 | Dominance: 0.9 | Intensity: 0.9 | Concreteness: 0.7
