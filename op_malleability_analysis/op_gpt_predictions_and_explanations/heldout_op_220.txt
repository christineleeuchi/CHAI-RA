Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument on the four dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—we can provide the following ratings on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the text:

### 1st Quarter
**Text: "CMV: 'Privilege' is a pretty self-evident concept. People who deny it are being willfully ignorant. I legitimately don't understand how anyone could deny that 'privilege' (as a sociological concept) exists. To me, it's so obvious that certain groups receive beneficial treatment as opposed to other groups."**

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The sentiment is strongly positive toward the concept of privilege, stating it as self-evident but negative toward those who deny it.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong position, indicating confidence in their viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The emotional intensity is moderate; while there is strong belief, it does not express extreme emotions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument is somewhat abstract but refers to specific groups receiving treatment, which provides some level of concreteness.)

### 2nd Quarter
**Text: "On the whole, it's easier to be white than any other race, easier to be straight than any other sexuality, easier to be cis than to be trans, easier to be male than female, easier to be wealthy than to be poor."**

- **Valence:** 0.9 (Very positive toward the concept of privilege; it presents clear and positive distinctions in privilege.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker asserts these ideas with confidence, indicating a strong stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There is significant emotional intensity in the comparative statements made.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Uses specific categories to illustrate the concept of privilege, adding to its clarity.)

### 3rd Quarter
**Text: "I think this is willful ignorance. No one is suggesting that 'privilege' is a zero-sum game, or that some types of privilege are more 'valuable' than others, or that all privilege exists in all situations."**

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Expresses a critical view of those who deny privilege, which could be seen negatively but maintains some neutral claims about privilege itself.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker takes a strong position against denial of privilege.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity with clear statements but not overly emotional.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Reasoning about the concept provides a clearer understanding of privilege.)

### 4th Quarter
**Text: "Unless you're a black, gay, poor, MtF trans-person, you experience privilege in some portion of your life. You probably don't notice it, because it's the way things have always been. But it's willfully ignorant to say that you're not 'privileged' because some people are in a better station than you are."**

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Strong assertion of privilege as a broad concept; suggests many people benefit from it.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Confidently asserts that most people have privilege, reinforcing the speaker's dominant view.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There’s substantial intensity in urging acknowledgment of privilege.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific examples and contextual references lend clarity to the argument but retain an overarching abstract concept.)

Overall, the argument is strongly framed around the notion of privilege with a clear stance against its denial, supported by comparative examples and a call for acknowledgment of varying forms of privilege.
