Here is a rating for each of the four dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—across the four quarters of the argument:

### 1st Quarter
**Valence:** 0.4 - The speaker presents a neutral to mildly positive perspective, acknowledging their lack of knowledge while expressing compassion for animals.
**Dominance:** 0.3 - The speaker positions themselves as somewhat open to learning, showing humility regarding their understanding of the topic.
**Intensity:** 0.3 - The tone is relatively calm, reflecting a willingness to engage without strong emotional weight.
**Concreteness:** 0.4 - There is some concrete mention of "not tested on animals" and experiences with "hippy kids," making the argument relatable but still somewhat abstract.

### 2nd Quarter
**Valence:** 0.6 - The speaker expresses clear values of compassion and willingness to pay more, which has a positive connotation.
**Dominance:** 0.5 - The speaker is asserting their ethical stance on animal rights, particularly regarding battery farms and puppy mills.
**Intensity:** 0.5 - There is a more moderate intensity here as the speaker openly discusses their position on eating meat.
**Concreteness:** 0.6 - This section provides more concrete examples of the speaker's beliefs, such as direct references to specific animal welfare issues.

### 3rd Quarter
**Valence:** 0.2 - This quarter discusses potential harm to animals, bringing about a negative sentiment as the speaker imagines suffering.
**Dominance:** 0.6 - The speaker takes a strong position regarding human safety taking precedence, asserting dominance in their argument.
**Intensity:** 0.7 - The discussion of animal suffering and the implications of human testing raises emotional stakes.
**Concreteness:** 0.5 - While the scenario is somewhat hypothetical, the mention of cruelty and human desperation adds some concrete elements to the argument.

### 4th Quarter
**Valence:** 0.4 - The speaker remains in a neutral zone, being open to the argument around makeup while still favoring animal testing as necessary.
**Dominance:** 0.5 - The speaker engages with the opposing argument while maintaining a balanced view, showing flexibility.
**Intensity:** 0.4 - The tone is moderated in examining the cosmetic argument, aiming for rationality over emotional focus.
**Concreteness:** 0.5 - References to existing cosmetics and previous discussions provide some grounding, but the argument remains abstract overall.

These scores reflect the emotional characteristics of the argument as presented across the different quarters, focusing on the speaker's tone, assertions, and the overall diegesis of their perspective on animal testing.
