Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument you provided using the specified dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), I will break it down into four quarters and assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each.

### Quarter 1:
"CMV: ‘Be yourself’ is a totally useless piece of advice. What does it even mean? How can one not be one-self? 
Now I’m mostly talking about the everyday use of the phrase – where it is typically offered moments before an uncomfortable or unfamiliar social interaction, like a date."

- **Valence**: 0.1 (The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative towards the phrase "be yourself.")
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The argument maintains control, questioning the validity of common advice.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The language suggests strong feelings about the topic, especially in the phrase "totally useless.")
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (While the argument is somewhat abstract, it provides context by referencing social interactions.)

### Quarter 2:
"And in this scenario, I assume it means something like ‘be yourself but without any of the debilitating neurosis and subsequent façade’. But this is just as useless. Don’t you think if people could magically wish away such impediments, they would have already done so? It’s possible that some people are able to do this – but then they presumably wouldn’t be in need of such banal advice."

- **Valence**: 0.1 (Continues to express negative sentiment about the advice and its implications.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker asserts a strong position against the advice, challenging its efficacy.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There is a heightened intensity here, especially with the word "banal.")
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Offers speculation about human behavior, making abstract ideas somewhat tangible.)

### Quarter 3:
"But even if you are held back by anxiety / hiding behind a façade etc. – are these things not an integral part of the ego that constitutes the ‘self’? Wouldn’t someone co-existing with these neuroses be closer to their ‘true self’ (whatever that is) than someone trying to change their mental state? Perhaps. Though how can anyone be ‘other’ than ‘themself’? It seems like whatever a person does, by definition, is being themself."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (Though critical, the tone here is more contemplative than outright dismissive.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The author introduces complex philosophical questions, maintaining control.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The intensity is balanced, as it shifts from strong claims to reflective questions.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The discussion of anxiety and its relation to identity makes this portion more concrete.)

### Quarter 4:
"Maybe ‘be yourself’ means ‘don’t pretend to be someone you’re not’? Again, this very act of pretending is still ‘me’ being ‘myself’. If I pretend, then I am a pretender, and that’s who I am. Does it mean ‘be your best self? If we could just flip a switch and become our ‘best self’ – wouldn’t everyone leave it on all the time? ‘Don’t overthink’? Fuck you. Don’t underthink. Is it just empty rhetoric meant as bit of comfort / a morale boost?  Well then don’t dress it up in misleading instructions. ‘There, there’ would be more useful / plain."

- **Valence**: 0.1 (The negativity is prominent, especially with the dismissive tone towards common advice.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The argument has a strong presence, clearly challenging various interpretations of the phrase.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The use of profanity and rhetorical questions increases the overall intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (This section discusses the implications of interpretations of ‘be yourself’, grounding abstract thoughts slightly more.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Quarter 1**: Valence 0.1, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.4
- **Quarter 2**: Valence 0.1, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 3**: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 4**: Valence 0.1, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.5

These scores represent an analysis of the argument's emotional tone, control, strength, and level of specificity.
