- **Concreteness:** 0.1 (Highly abstract, not providing specifics to support the claim.)

### 2nd Quarter:
*"So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german goods and compare them to nazi's."*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Neutral to slightly negative; describes actions without expressing much sympathy.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (More assertive in presenting observations about Greek actions.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The mention of comparisons to Nazis raises the emotional stakes, which increases intensity.)

### 4th Quarter:
*"Yes, its the government's fault and not the people's, but they can't reasonably refuse cuts to their public spending that they can no longer afford, and moreover, why blame the eurozone for trying to help, and not their own incompetent government? Edit: And striking, as if their country didn't have enough problems already?!"*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed; acknowledges government failures but still criticizes Greek reactions.)
