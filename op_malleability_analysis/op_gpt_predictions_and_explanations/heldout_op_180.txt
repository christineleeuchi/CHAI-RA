### First Quarter:
“CMV: I don't see any reason not to vote for Bernie Sanders Pretty much all of my social media feeds are a massive hive mind, a huge circlejerk of Sanders quotes and video clips. He seems fantastic, but I'm honestly struggling to find anything bad about him online.”

- **Valence (0.9):** The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive towards Bernie Sanders, although there is a hint of skepticism regarding the surrounding social media culture.
- **Dominance (0.3):** The speaker appears to be sharing personal thoughts rather than asserting a dominant opinion; they're seeking input.

- **Valence (0.8):** The desire to be informed and see both sides is positive, though it reflects some uncertainty.
