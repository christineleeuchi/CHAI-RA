Here's a rating score for the provided argument on each of the requested dimensions:

1. **Valence**:
   - **Score**: 0.3
   - **Explanation**: The overall tone of the argument is somewhat negative towards Kanji while being more positive about Hiragana. The author's frustration with Kanji is evident, leading to a marginally low valence due to the expressed dissatisfaction.

2. **Dominance**:
   - **Score**: 0.6
   - **Explanation**: The author presents their points in a structured and clear manner, indicating a degree of confidence in their argument. While the argument doesn't completely negate the value of Kanji, it asserts the superiority of Hiragana based on practicality, giving it a moderate level of dominance.

3. **Intensity**:
   - **Score**: 0.4
   - **Explanation**: The intensity of the argument can be considered moderate. While the frustrations with Kanji are expressed, the overall tone remains somewhat measured. The arguments are backed by personal experience rather than strong emotional language, resulting in a moderate intensity score.

4. **Concreteness**:
   - **Score**: 0.5
   - **Explanation**: The argument contains concrete examples (e.g., the discussion of specific Kanji, the memorization difficulty, writing efficiency, etc.) to back the points made. However, the argument also relies on personal experiences and subjective opinions, giving it a balanced but not fully concrete nature.

These scores reflect an evaluation based on the argumentâ€™s emotional tone, assertiveness, emotional appeal, and the clarity of its claims and evidence.
