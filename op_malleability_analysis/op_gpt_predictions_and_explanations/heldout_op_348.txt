Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument you've provided, I'll break it down into four quarters and assign ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each section. 

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: The number of seats which a state has in the House of Representatives should be determined by the number of eligible voters in that state. If a state has 18 million people, with only 10 million eligible to vote. Than that state's house seats should only reflect the 10 million people rather than the 18 million people."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is somewhat neutral, focusing on an argument but presents implications that could be interpreted as lacking fairness toward non-voters.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument presents a clear stake in the issue of representation and indicates a standpoint that challenges the current framework effectively.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The language isnâ€™t emotionally charged but asserts a clear position prompting consideration.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The argument is based on concrete data regarding population and eligibility, making it relatable and measurable.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "While representatives claim to be serving all people in their district, they really only care about those who can vote."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (This statement is factual but carries a slight negative connotation regarding representatives' intentions, suggesting a lack of integrity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly asserts a critical view of political motivations, maintaining a level of conviction.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately intense, as it challenges accepted norms about representation.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument provides a direct assertion that can be examined in the context of voting behavior and policy decisions.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "This is why no politicians care about prisons or orphans. The only reason why politicians care about public schools is because the parents of public school children can vote. This is also why the drinking age has not been lowered."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This portion is relatively negative, stating that politicians neglect certain demographics unless they have voting power.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument competently conveys the idea that certain issues are overlooked, establishing a somewhat confrontational stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There is heightened intensity in stating the neglect of vulnerable populations.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While the claims evoke discussion, the examples provided could use more specific evidence or case studies for stronger grounding.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "Until politicians start listening to those who cannot vote, they should not be awarded seats which include those members of the population who cannot vote. To change my view, you must provide clear examples of politicians listening to those who cannot vote, and really taking their ideas into consideration."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The caller for change is neutral but reflects frustration with the current political system.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Assertive and demands a high level of accountability from politicians, indicating a strong belief in a structural change.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The language here pushes for advocacy, invoking a sense of urgency around the issue.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The request for examples provides direction but remains somewhat abstract since it does not specify certain cases or data.)

Overall, each quarter contributes to a well-structured argument, with varying degrees of emotional weight, intensity, and solid grounding in observable phenomena.
