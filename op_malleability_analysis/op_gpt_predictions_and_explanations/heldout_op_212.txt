Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s my rating for each category across the four quarters of the argument:

### First Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.8 (The sentiment is predominantly negative towards phone usage in social settings.)
**Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker expresses a strong opinion and sense of authority over the matter.)
**Intensity:** 0.7 (There is a strong emotional element in the expression of rudeness and disrespect.)
**Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument presents specific social contexts but is somewhat abstract in discussing disrespect.)

### Second Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.9 (The negativity about phone usage becomes more pronounced, emphasizing discomfort and rudeness.)
**Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker asserts a clear stance against phone absorption.)
**Intensity:** 0.8 (The speaker's frustration is more evident here, enhancing the intensity.)
**Concreteness:** 0.6 (It continues to convey specific feelings but remains more subjective.)

### Third Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.7 (While still negative, there’s a slight acknowledgment of choice and social norms.)
**Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker reflects on the societal acceptance of phone use, which softens the dominance slightly.)
**Intensity:** 0.7 (The internal conflict of the urge to use the phone versus the desire to be present maintains intensity.)
**Concreteness:** 0.7 (Some examples of social interactions are mentioned, adding concreteness.)

### Fourth Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.9 (The statement about feeling insulted and wasting time heightens the negativity.)
**Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker reinforces their authority in the discussion about consideration for others.)
**Intensity:** 0.9 (The emotional weight of feeling insulted and frustrated is at its peak.)
**Concreteness:** 0.7 (The focus on social situations provides grounded examples, but remains general.)

These ratings reflect the overall nature and intent of each quarter of the argument, with a focus on emotional and intellectual engagement.
