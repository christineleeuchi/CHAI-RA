Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To analyze the argument based on the score categories of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text provided, we'll break it down into four segments and rate each segment:

### Quarter 1: 
"CMV: Using the box when you're making a puzzle is cheating and defeats the purpose of the puzzle."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative sentiment; "cheating" suggests disapproval)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong viewpoint expressed with assertive language)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity; expressing a clear dislike)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Clear and direct argument about the act of using the box)

### Quarter 2:
"In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to slightly positive; ideal scenario presented)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (More of a hypothetical suggestion rather than a strong claim)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low intensity; more of a wishful thinking)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific suggestion but remains hypothetical)

### Quarter 3:
"But alas, it doesn't work that way, for the pretty good trade off reason of people want to know that they're getting a quality puzzle, which makes sense to me."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Balanced view; acknowledges the trade-off, but still slightly negative)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate, recognizing both sides but favoring his perspective)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (A bit of frustration but not very intense)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear reasoning provided for the current situation)

### Quarter 4:
"But I can't stand when you're making a puzzle with people and they want to check the box. The point is to enjoy the slight but time-passing pleasure of discovery a picture by putting it together."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (Very negative sentiment conveyed towards checking the box)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Clear assertion of the speaker's frustration)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Intense feeling towards the act of checking the box)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Describes the pleasure and enjoyment aspect clearly)

### Summary:
1. **Quarter 1**: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.8
2. **Quarter 2**: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.3, Concreteness 0.6
3. **Quarter 3**: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.7
4. **Quarter 4**: Valence 0.1, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.8
