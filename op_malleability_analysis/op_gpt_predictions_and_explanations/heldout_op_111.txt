**Intensity:** 0.6  
(There is a noticeable frustration regarding the perceived ineffectiveness of mantras, reflecting a strong emotional response.)

**Concreteness:** 0.7  
(Concrete experiences with self-help techniques and the upcoming example of a specific mantra give it a tangible quality.)

### Second Quarter
**Valence:** 0.2

(This quarter expresses moderate intensity, as the speaker grapples with the idea while maintaining skepticism.)

**Concreteness:** 0.6  
(Specific examples of mantras and suggestion are still presented, but the discussion becomes more abstract regarding self-belief.)

### Third Quarter

(The argument shifts slightly, as it acknowledges the validity of psychological approaches but remains doubtful about applying them personally.)

**Dominance:** 0.5

**Intensity:** 0.5

**Concreteness:** 0.5

### Fourth Quarter
**Valence:** 0.3  
(Continues the skepticism toward mantras, emphasizing feelings of discomfort with the idea.)

**Dominance:** 0.5  
(The speaker maintains their critical stance but invites dialogue for change, showing a blend of dominance and vulnerability.)
