Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the categories of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument's text:

### 1st Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.3 (The tone is somewhat negative toward public sentiment but offers a different perspective.)
**Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts their opinion firmly but does acknowledge opposing viewpoints.)
**Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity due to the strong wording like "ridiculous" and references to dramatic shifts like "police state.")
**Concreteness:** 0.4 (Some abstract concepts are discussed without specific examples in this quarter.)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.1 (Very negative historical references contribute to a low valence.)
**Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker takes a strong, assertive stance about the historical injustices.)
**Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument's intensity increases with the gravity of historical issues mentioned.)
**Concreteness:** 0.7 (This section provides specific historical examples, making it more concrete.)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.2 (While it acknowledges current issues, the overall sentiment remains negative.)
**Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker continues to dominate the argument with assertive claims.)
**Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity as it aims to counteract the negative perception with historical context.)
**Concreteness:** 0.6 (Some concrete details are provided about current practices, but it's still somewhat abstract.)

### 4th Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.4 (Ending on a somewhat positive note about historical progress, but still critical.)
**Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker maintains a firm position, summarizing their argument.)
**Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity as it concludes with a softer perspective.)
**Concreteness:** 0.5 (While the final conclusion is clear, it relies on overarching comparisons rather than new specific examples.)

These ratings are subjective and can vary based on interpretation, but they reflect the argumentative structure and sentiment present in the text.
