Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Hereâ€™s a rating for each of the specified dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for the quarters of the provided argument:

### Quarter 1: "CMV: Telling someone 'They're alive in your heart' after a death is callous and flippant..."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (The statement is negative, expressing disapproval of a common sentiment in grief.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The argument is assertive and positions the author in a strong, dominant perspective against the phrase.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The language is strong and emotive, suggesting deep feelings about the pain of loss.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it discusses specific sentiments, the concepts are somewhat abstract regarding emotional experiences.)

### Quarter 2: "The only things that heal are the religious belief that you'll see them again someday..."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (There is still negativity, particularly towards the idea of remembering someone as healing.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Maintains a strong position, dismissing alternative views of healing in grief.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The emphasis on 'healing' suggests significant emotional weight, but less intense than the first quarter.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The ideas of religious belief and time as healing mechanisms are more specific but still abstract.)

### Quarter 3: "EDIT: Several people have pointed out that if you carry their advice with you..."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (This quarter acknowledges differing opinions, yielding a more neutral tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author softens their stance, acknowledging that others may have valid perspectives.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate as the author reflects rather than asserts.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (References concrete actions like "feeding the homeless," providing clear examples of keeping a legacy.)

### Quarter 4: "All of these things may be helpful IF it appears that the person doesn't already know it..."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixes acknowledgment of other perspectives with a disclaimer, leaning toward a neutral or slightly negative tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Maintains an assertive tone but presents it in a more cautious manner.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The emotional intensity is lower as it focuses on contemplative reasoning rather than strong feelings.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The metaphor about coping with loss is more concrete, but the overall message remains somewhat abstract.)

These ratings reflect the emotional and cognitive dimensions of the argument presented in each quarter.
