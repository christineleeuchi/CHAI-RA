Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here are the ratings for the argument provided, broken down into four quarters:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: White people portraying other races without the use of cariacatures or stereotypes is not blackface."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The statement has a somewhat neutral valence; it isn't overly positive or negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument makes a claim, but it isnâ€™t presented in an authoritative manner.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Mildly intense, as it challenges a well-known concept but lacks strong emotional language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The concept is clear and defined but relies on the interpretation of "blackface.")

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "I have yet to understand why a straight actor can portray a gay character while can't the same be same for white people portraying other races."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it raises a question without a positive or negative stance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (It expresses confusion rather than authority, which weakens its dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (A moderate intensity as it questions societal norms.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It's a clear question, but the reliance on contextual societal norms makes it somewhat abstract.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "If an unknown white actor portrayed black character with a rounded story, un-cariacatural appearance, etc., and slipped under the radar, why should there be any problem if people find out the actor was white."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Leans towards a positive view about well-developed characters but implies controversy.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Greater sense of authority as it presents a hypothetical scenario.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong intensity due to the provocative nature of the question.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Concreteness is reduced by the hypothetical nature, though the elements are specific.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Even though I understand why the minstrel shows of the past had been racist, if a black (or any other race) character had been thought to be well developed, not-racist without the context of the character, etc. I don't think it should be comparable to blackface."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (More negative as it acknowledges past racism but tries to redefine an understanding.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Presents a counter-argument but lacks strong authoritative support.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Somewhat intense as it contrasts historical racism with a desire for understanding.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Reasonably concrete but still relies on abstract concepts of racism and character development.)
