Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Certainly! I'll break down the argument into quarters and then provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the following dimensions: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: Being gay is not a choice."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive stance on sexual orientation)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Authoritative declaration)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity in proclaiming the argument)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Abstract statement, lacks specific evidence yet)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Although some scientific arguments have been made that some women possess some elasticity with their sexuality, several scientific articles specifically state that males are born and fully develop their sexuality by puberty."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Neutral but leaning towards positive with evidence)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Citing scientific authority strengthens the claim)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity; asserts a clearer stance)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (More concrete as it references specific scientific arguments)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "Furthermore, they have located a specific gene, xq28, that they believe is specifically linked to an inborn sexuality."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive, as it supports the argument scientifically)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong authoritative claim due to gene reference)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Higher intensity because of the specificity of claims)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete; references specific scientific findings)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "Also, although one can change their behavior, doing so against one's true self can lead to long-term mental anguish, torture, depression, and possibly suicide."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Negative consequences described)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Slightly less authoritative, focused on consequences)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (High intensity; strong emotional language)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat concrete because it describes potential real-world impacts)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **Quarter 1:**  
  Valence: 0.8  
  Dominance: 0.6  
  Intensity: 0.5  
  Concreteness: 0.4  

- **Quarter 2:**  
  Valence: 0.6  
  Dominance: 0.7  
  Intensity: 0.6  
  Concreteness: 0.7  

- **Quarter 3:**  
  Valence: 0.7  
  Dominance: 0.8  
  Intensity: 0.7  
  Concreteness: 0.8  

- **Quarter 4:**  
  Valence: 0.4  
  Dominance: 0.5  
  Intensity: 0.9  
  Concreteness: 0.6  

These scores reflect the emotional tone, authority of claim, strength of expression, and levels of specificity in each part of the argument.
