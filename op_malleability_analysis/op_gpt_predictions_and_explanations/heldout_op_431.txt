Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument on the scales of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness from 0.0 to 1.0, we can break it down into four quarters. Here are the assessments:

### Quarter 1: 
**Text:** "CMV: I shouldn't rally against social structures which benefit me [white, male, hetero privilege] The people closest to me, in my opinion benefit from these privileges too. So, what's my motivation to vote/fight against them?"

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment expresses a degree of acceptance of privilege but lacks positive sentiment towards change.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument presents an assertive stance but is more reflective than commanding.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Thereâ€™s a strong feeling of self-awareness and questioning.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The statement refers to identifiable social structures and personal connections.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "#1 Privilege isn't zero sum - you can increase it for everyone. How? Evening the playing field means that those that are benefiting will lose some of their advantages, however unfair they may be in the first place. How else could it work?"

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is somewhat negative towards the idea of privilege distribution.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument challenges a prevailing idea, showing assertiveness in questioning the benefits of the current systems.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a moderate level of intensity as it invites reconsideration of privilege dynamics.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The points made are clear and refer to specific concepts of privilege and equality.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "#2 Because you value equality and fairness. I used to think I did until I looked at my behavior, and realized that I only paid lip service to these values."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The reflection introduces a negative view on personal values, which carries a sense of defeat.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This segment is somewhat less assertive, as it focuses on internal reflection rather than a call to action.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There is notable intensity in the self-criticism and realization of hypocrisy.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It discusses values and personal behavior, although it's more abstract than the previous quarter.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "How many of you are for completely open borders? How many of you give away the majority of your paychecks to help others born into extreme poverty? Most people do enough to ease their conscience - which is normally an amount which doesn't threaten their position of western privilege. Yay, you give $30 a month. What happens when you're asked to make a real sacrifice? Do you still believe in equality then? I think when push comes to shove, you will protect your easy life. Why shouldn't I do the same?"

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This section conveys a strong skepticism and negativity towards the idea of altruism.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The argument here is very dominant, directly challenging the reader and their beliefs.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (The intensity is very high, as it strongly confronts perceived hypocrisy and invokes emotional responses.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The points made refer to specific behaviors and concepts, solidly grounded in reality.)

These ratings reflect the emotional and cognitive aspects of the argument, showing both the challenges of privilege and the complexities of motivations for change.
