Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on the requested dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the text, I will provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0 as follows:

### Quarter 1:
*Text:* "CMV: A more financially well-off person should NOT be frowned upon if they only pay for their half on a date. If one party decides to pay for the other, that's out of their generosity and that's up to them. But the more well-off person should not be criticised for only paying for their half."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive; promotes the idea of not judging someone's financial decisions)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderate; presents a clear stance but acknowledges the potential for differing opinions)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Considerable; uses strong language like "NOT be frowned upon")
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Moderate; somewhat abstract but provides a clear example of a date scenario)

### Quarter 2:
*Text:* "Since some people are old-fashioned and tend to expect for the man to pay for the woman, how about we reverse the role? Should a woman from an affluent background *have* to pay for a man who earns less than she does? Sure, if she wants to pay for him, that's up to her. But should she be frowned upon because she only pays for what she is spending on?"

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive; challenges traditional gender roles regarding payment in dating)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Neutral; presents a hypothetical scenario without a definitive answer)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate; invites reflection on gender norms)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concrete in posing a real-world scenario and questions)

### Quarter 3:
*Text:* "Also, if you are a successful businessman/woman, isn't paying for only your bit on a date a way to weed out (some of) the gold diggers?"

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; can be seen as pragmatic but slightly negative)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced; presents a point but doesn't aggressively advocate for it)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Moderate; introduces the concept of "gold diggers" which has strong implications)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete; presents a clear rationale for the argument)

### Quarter 4:
*Text:* "I believe that the person with the higher earning should be allowed to spend *their* money on *their* wishes. They are **not** obliged to spend it on somebody just because they are more fortunate, although doing so can be an act of kindness. Paying for the other person, as a more financially well-off person, is a generous gesture but should not be frowned upon if they only pay for their half. I have noticed that many people tend to criticise the higher earner if they do not pay for the other person on a date."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive; reinforces the freedom of choice regarding financial matters)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong; the author asserts a clear viewpoint)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate; emphasizes individual choice using "not obliged")
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat abstract but reinforces the earlier points)

These ratings reflect the emotional and intellectual weight of each quarter of the argument, as well as how tangible and clear the ideas are presented.
