Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here is a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: Allowing your prepubescent child to become severely over/underweight is child abuse. It is absolutely essential to keep a child at a normal weight."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The view expressed is negative towards neglecting child health, but there's a sense of urgency to protect children.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument asserts a strong position on parental responsibility.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The term "child abuse" conveys a high emotional charge.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument refers to abstract concepts of abuse and health without specific examples yet.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Parents in this day and age should have advice and information on what healthy eating actually is. Allowing your kids to develop a condition such as obesity, which leads to severe cardiovascular damage on all levels and a shortened life, could be seen as bad parenting."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The sentiment remains negative concerning neglecting children's health.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The emphasis is on parental responsibility, while also acknowledging societal factors.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Health consequences described increase the emotional weight of the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The text begins to present specific health outcomes related to obesity.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "Parental failure to provide their children with adequate treatment for a chronic illness (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc) is a well accepted reason for a child protection registration for neglect."

- **Valence:** 0.9 (This statement sounds very negative for parents failing to seek treatment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (It strongly reinforces the idea of parental obligation and responsibility.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (While very serious, the comparison to chronic illness is a calmer tone than some earlier claims.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific illness examples give this section more tangible meaning.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "I believe that childhood obesity becomes a child protection concern when parents behave in a way that actively promotes treatment failure in a child who is at serious risk from their weight and when the parents or carers understand what is required. Even though others may point out the existence of factors such as the marketing of unhealthy foods, the primary responsibility falls on the parents every time. Existing laws could be applied."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (This concludes with a strong view on parental responsibility, steering clear of blaming external factors.)
- **Dominance:** 0.9 (Emphasizes parental agency and accountability.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The closing remarks reinforce the seriousness of the consequences.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Discussion of laws and responsibilities provides a solid foundation for the argument.)

These scores reflect how each quarter of the argument presents its message on child obesity and parental responsibility.
