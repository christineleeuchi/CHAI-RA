Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter, I will divide the argument into four sections as follows:

1. **Quarter 1**: "CMV: The severity of police brutality cases has been largely overblown by biased media coverage."
2. **Quarter 2**: "Let me start out by saying that I do not deny that police brutality is a serious issue and actions to prevent it are understandable from any viewpoint."
3. **Quarter 3**: "My argument however is that the media has been looking for cases with such scrutiny that it has placed a very unfair and negative image on law enforcement as a whole."
4. **Quarter 4**: "I believe it is entirely a case of the few bad apples spoil the bunch and that overeager enthusiasts have jumped aboard the hype-train breeding more antipolice sentiments than ever necessary towards all officers, causing those who are indeed just trying to do their job with no prejudice to tiptoe on glass and is actually hindering them from doing their job effectively."

### Ratings:

#### Quarter 1:
- **Valence**: 0.2 (The statement casts a negative light on media coverage, reflecting a negative valence).
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion in regard to media scrutiny).
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The use of "overblown" carries a moderate intensity in expressing the opinion).
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (The argument is somewhat abstract, focusing on perceptions rather than tangible instances of police brutality.)

#### Quarter 2:
- **Valence**: 0.8 (Acknowledge the seriousness of police brutality shows a positive valence towards preventing it).
- **Dominance**: 0.3 (The tone is more conciliatory, suggesting understanding rather than domination).
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity in expressing a reasonable perspective).
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (It references actions to prevent police brutality but remains somewhat general).

#### Quarter 3:
- **Valence**: 0.1 (Negative portrayal of media creates a very negative valence).
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The statement strongly asserts a belief about media bias).
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Describing the media's actions as "unfair" and "negative" conveys a strong sentiment).
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (The argument still deals with general perceptions rather than individual concrete examples).

#### Quarter 4:
- **Valence**: 0.2 (Expresses negative sentiments towards "overeager enthusiasts" and their impact on public perception).
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strong assertion about consequences affecting police officers).
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (High intensity with phrases like "tiptoe on glass" and “hype-train breeding”).
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Includes metaphorical language that may convey real implications but remains abstract overall).
