Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To assess the argument using the specified criteria, I will analyze each quarter of the argument regarding valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, providing a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each attribute.

### Quarter 1:
"CMV: Climate change should be every politician's first priority, and we are doing too little about it, since no one seems to care anymore..."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The statement carries a strong positive valence, advocating for prioritizing climate change, but expresses concern about inaction.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument presents a strong assertion about the priority of climate change in politics.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The tone is quite urgent, emphasizing the need for action and expressing frustration.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat vague about specific actions, but references a shared understanding of the issue.)

### Quarter 2:
"Climate change has been a problem for decades and we have done very little about it. The Kyoto Protocol had obviously failed, and had since become forgotten..."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is somewhat negative, reflecting on failures and inaction, but highlighting the significance of the issue.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It maintains authority by pointing out failures in past efforts, contributing to the argument's strength.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (This quarter conveys a sense of disappointment regarding past actions and their outcomes.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Citing specific events like the Kyoto Protocol lends concrete examples to the argument.)

### Quarter 3:
"I'm not an expert on climate but statistics do serve as solid evidence for this issue, and it had been viewed as one of the fastest growing problems of the century."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The inclusion of statistics suggests a positive outlook on using evidence to support climate action, though there's an acknowledgment of lack of expertise.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The statement is more about presenting evidence rather than making a dominant claim.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (It conveys a moderate sense of urgency regarding climate change statistics.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The reference to statistics provides a solid grounding for the argument and establishes it as a significant issue.)

### Quarter 4:
"I understand preventing climate change is not as feasible as it looks, regarding economic, environmental and societal factors; not to mention the controversial opinions and theories surrounding it..."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Balanced tone, recognizing challenges while still advocating for action, which introduces some negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This portion becomes more reflective and acknowledges complexities, which may dilute assertiveness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, recognizing challenges without the urgency present in earlier sections.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Some specific examples of challenges are mentioned, lending a degree of concreteness, yet still remains somewhat abstract.)

### Summary of Scores:
**Quarter 1**: Valence: 0.8 | Dominance: 0.7 | Intensity: 0.8 | Concreteness: 0.6   
**Quarter 2**: Valence: 0.6 | Dominance: 0.6 | Intensity: 0.7 | Concreteness: 0.7   
**Quarter 3**: Valence: 0.7 | Dominance: 0.5 | Intensity: 0.6 | Concreteness: 0.8   
**Quarter 4**: Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.4 | Intensity: 0.5 | Concreteness: 0.6  

These ratings reflect the strength, clarity, and emotional undertones of each part of the argument.
