Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument provided based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, let's break down each quarter of the argument separately.

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV: I agree with Justice Scalia's ruling on the death penalty (Glossip v. Gross) First let me say that I strongly disagree with the death penalty and would like very much to see it abolished; I just feel it should be done with an amendment, rather than by a supreme court ruling."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Mixed feelings about the death penalty itself, expressing both agreement with Scalia and personal opposition to the penalty.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (There is a strong voice indicating a personal stance, but also an acknowledgement of the legal framework, suggesting some power dynamics.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Expresses strong feelings against the death penalty but presents them alongside a nuanced legal argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Discusses both personal belief and legal processes, but isn't deeply detailed about the implications.)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** "Justice Scalia states that it is the court's responsibility to decide whether or not laws violate the constitution. Glossip contested that lethal injection violated the 8th amendment (cruel and unusual punishment.) Breye's dissent argued that the death penalty, in and of itself, is cruel and unusual punishment."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Leans slightly positive in recognizing the role of the court, but discusses the serious implications of the death penalty.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Reflects a balance of opinions between Scalia's position and Breye's dissent.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The discussion of legal responsibility adds a sense of weight and urgency to the issue.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (More factual and grounded, provides specific legal references about the Eighth Amendment and context of the case.)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "The authors of the constitution were well aware of the death penalty (which, at the time, was the only punishment for a felony), and had they meant for it to be outlawed, they would have specifically mentioned it."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive valence as it argues for an interpretation of original intent in a legal context.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Firmly asserts a specific interpretation of historical context, leaning towards a strong viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity, as it discusses historical implications and constitutional interpretation.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Provides a clear, specific argument rooted in historical context.)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "You might consider hanging or firing squads (the methods used at the time the constitution was written) to be more humane than lethal injection, but this argument could be countered by simply giving the inmate a choice between the three. I feel that Scalia is just doing the job he was appointed to do. It is not the place of the supreme court to make or strike down laws based on what they feel is right or wrong. It is their job to interpret whether or not laws violate the constitution. It is our job as a population to elect representatives to change the law."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Somewhat neutral, focusing on procedural aspects rather than emotional weight.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Stronger assertion of a belief in judicial roles; more confidence in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Maintains a steady intensity throughout, suggesting practical solutions and interpretations.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concreteness is higher due to specific references to legal responsibilities and processes.)

### Summary of Ratings:
- 1st Quarter: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
- 2nd Quarter: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.7
- 3rd Quarter: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8
- 4th Quarter: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7

These scores reflect a mix of personal beliefs, legal interpretations, and the complexity of discussing the ethics of the death penalty within a constitutional framework.
