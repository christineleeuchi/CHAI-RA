Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To assess the argument provided, I will rate each quarter of the text on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. Here are the scores for each quarter:

### Quarter 1

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment is somewhat negative towards comparing male and female players.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument presents a strong claim about the performance difference.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The phrasing "9.5 out of 10 times" adds intensity to the claim.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some concrete points start to emerge, though not fully elaborated yet.)

### Quarter 2

- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument relies on historical matches to assert dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The references to specific matches add to the intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This section uses historical evidence and specific examples, enhancing concreteness.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Also the whole Female World Cup players should be paid the same is total BS in my opinion for two reasons ... If they want the same tournament winnings they should be advocating for a single tournament..."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (This expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the argument for equal pay.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author firmly positions their viewpoint as the dominant one.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The phrase "total BS" adds significant intensity to the opinion expressed.)
