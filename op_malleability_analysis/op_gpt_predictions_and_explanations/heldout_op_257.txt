Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text, I'll break it down accordingly and provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each category. 

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: The amount of finger pointing and agenda molding in American politics has become disgustingly inappropriate and is senselessly preventing the solutions to the real issues."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative connotation regarding politics)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong assertion about political behavior)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong, emotionally charged language, especially "disgustingly inappropriate")
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Some abstractions, but mentions "real issues")

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "So this is an opinion I've had for a while, but after a recent bout of returning to watching certain news stations, it has been grinding my gears particularly of late."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Personal frustration expressed)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Personal opinion without commanding authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Emotional response "grinding my gears" indicates some intensity)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Reference to watching news stations adds some context, but still vague)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "To me it seems that any tragic event which is deemed worthy to be broadcasted semi-nationally to nationally becomes fodder for both sides of the political spectrum to either smear the opposition or further their own agenda to a point of being disrespectful of those involved."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (Negative view of political exploitation of tragedies)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Strong critique of both political sides)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong language, phrasing like "fodder" adds depth)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Refers to events but remains somewhat abstract in examples)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "Along with values of disrespect, instead of actually addressing the issues at hand and working to form a solution to actually fix the issues at hand, both sides are so caught up in their own hot air that they refuse to work together and are actually being a detriment to any positive progress."

- **Valence:** 0.0 (Very negative view of political discourse)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong, definitive critique on political inaction)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (Very strong language, "hot air" and "detriment" indicate high intensity)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Discusses abstract ideas about solutions, less concrete examples)

### Summary of Scores
| Quarter  | Valence | Dominance | Intensity | Concreteness |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Quarter 1| 0.2     | 0.7       | 0.8       | 0.4          |
