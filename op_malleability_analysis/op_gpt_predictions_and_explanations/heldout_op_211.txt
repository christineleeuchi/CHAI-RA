Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Let's break down the argument into four quarters and rate them on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### 1st Quarter: 
**Argument:** "CMV: within the next few decades, AI will replace a sizable portion of our jobs. Within a few centuries, they'll replace almost all of them."  
- **Valence:** 0.2 (The sentiment is negative due to the concerning implications of job loss.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument expresses a strong prediction, but it is not overly aggressive. It suggests a significant future impact.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The use of "sizable portion" conveys a strong urgency and seriousness.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While the argument is based on observable trends, the future predictions are somewhat abstract.)

### 2nd Quarter: 
**Argument:** "It's already been happening with factory workers, online shopping, etc., and with self-driving cars on the horizon and computing technology getting better and better, the long-term job security for many professions is shaky at best."  
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Still negative, as it points out ongoing job displacement.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (It asserts the reality of current trends, which adds authority to the claim.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The phrase "shaky at best" conveys a high level of concern regarding job security.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This section includes specific examples, making it more grounded, though it still deals with predictions.)

### 3rd Quarter: 
**Argument:** "This surge in unemployment may even cause a great economic crisis."  
- **Valence:** 0.1 (Highly negative, as it discusses potential economic crisis.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strongly asserts the possibility of a significant negative outcome.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (Very intense, as it suggests vast implications for society.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (More abstract since it discusses potential future consequences rather than current situations.)

### 4th Quarter: 
**Argument:** "With many humans out of jobs, I've heard talks of unconditional basic income eventually being required. Indeed, the idea that everyone should have a job may become more arbitrary as time goes on as fewer people are able to contribute to the economy. Robots will simply do everything better, making humans far less useful and needed."  
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative due to the implications of increasing irrelevance of human labor.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument is strong and presents a clear perspective on the future of work and income.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The assertion that robots will do everything better is provocative and strong.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Discussion of basic income gives some grounding, but the overall implications remain quite abstract.)

### Summary:
1st Quarter: Valence (0.2), Dominance (0.6), Intensity (0.7), Concreteness (0.5)  
2nd Quarter: Valence (0.3), Dominance (0.7), Intensity (0.8), Concreteness (0.6)  
3rd Quarter: Valence (0.1), Dominance (0.8), Intensity (0.9), Concreteness (0.4)  
4th Quarter: Valence (0.2), Dominance (0.7), Intensity (0.8), Concreteness (0.5)
