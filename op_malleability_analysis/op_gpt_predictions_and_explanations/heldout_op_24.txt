Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I've broken down the argument into four quarters. Here are the ratings on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for each aspect:

### Quarter 1: 
"I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a person does to themselves. It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (The sentiment expresses a negative view towards obesity but is somewhat tempered by a call for understanding.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The person is asserting their opinion while acknowledging potential pushback.)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (The language is not overly aggressive, but there is a clear stance taken.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (There are specific claims made about obesity being avoidable, but it lacks specific details or evidence at this point.)

### Quarter 2:
"However, I still think it's a disability because it makes it harder to perform every day tasks."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (This part acknowledges a challenge faced by obese individuals, conveying some empathy.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker asserts their view more firmly here.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The statement about difficulty in performing tasks is significant, but it's still fairly straightforward.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (While it suggests a clear consequence of obesity, it still lacks specific examples or data.)

### Quarter 3:
"Here's a comparison that I use. Imagine you cut off your leg with a hacksaw, for no good reason. You're now missing a leg, and I would consider you to be disabled."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (This metaphor can be seen as harsh and may invoke negative feelings; it compares obesity to a severe self-inflicted injury.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The comparison is strong and attempts to assert a definitive position.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The imagery is very stark and intense, drawing a strong parallel to disability.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The metaphor is vivid and creates a clear picture, but metaphorical language can also be seen as less concrete in terms of building a rational argument.)

### Quarter 4:
"You might argue that someone who cuts off their own leg obviously has some mental issues, but that could be said for a person who allows themself to become severely obese. For example, depression leads to overeating for many people."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (This section does introduce a nuanced perspective on mental health, but still retains a somewhat critical tone.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker maintains their stance while addressing potential counterarguments.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Itâ€™s thoughtful but also asserts a negative view of obesity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The reference to depression and its relationship with overeating is more concrete and grounded in real-world issues, though it generalizes about mental health.)

These ratings reflect an analysis of the argument through each quarter. The argument is multifaceted, presenting a mix of assertive claims and nuanced considerations.
