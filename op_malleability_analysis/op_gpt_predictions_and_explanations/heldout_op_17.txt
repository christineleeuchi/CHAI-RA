Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument:

**Quarter 1: "CMV: I am a father who hates Father's Day. I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Mixed feelings; love for family but negative feelings toward Father's Day)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker expresses a strong personal stance regarding Father’s Day)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The use of "hate" conveys strong emotion)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (There is a mix of personal experience and abstract sentiment)

**Quarter 2: "I feel the 'holiday', if one can call it that, forces people to adopt a tradition that bills itself very similarly to a birthday...which I already have once a year."**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative sentiment towards the holiday)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is asserting their viewpoint strongly)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity in critique, with emphasis on being forced into tradition)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific comparison to birthdays adds clarity)

**Quarter 3: "If you want to appreciate someone it should be done on an individual basis and *not* based on some yearly Hallmark Holiday. Yes, I feel the same about Mother's Day, but I'll be damned if I don't go through the motions."**
- **Valence:** 0.4 (A mix of frustration with social expectations, yet some acceptance)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (A balancing act of asserting and also recognizing societal norms)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The phrase "I'll be damned if I don't" conveys a strong response)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Abstract concept of appreciation mixed with personal acknowledgment)

**Quarter 4: "I feel much the same way about many of the other 'appreciation days' (e.g. Administrative Professionals Day, Thank a Mailman Day, etc.). You are thanking someone for doing what they *chose* to do. Society should not force an expectation on others to give you praise for the things you choose to do or become."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Continued negative sentiment towards societal expectations)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is speaking broadly about societal norms and critique)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Consistent passion but generalizes to other appreciation days, reducing sharpness)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Uses specific examples to illustrate the point, adding clarity)

These ratings are subjective, as different readers may interpret the emotions, strength, and clarity differently, but they reflect the overall tone and content of each section of the argument.
