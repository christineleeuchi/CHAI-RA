Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument you provided, I’ll assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the following dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—across four quarters of the text. 

**Quarter 1:**
"CMV: Police officers who kill citizens for any reason should be placed under arrest by another officer for murder. With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more repercussions to an officer that kills a citizen."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The argument presents a negative view of police actions, indicating a strong sense of frustration and dissatisfaction.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a clear opinion and demands accountability but does not dismiss opposing viewpoints.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The language reflects strong emotions, particularly frustration and urgency for change.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument provides concrete statistics but lacks detailed explanations of specific cases or policies.)

**Quarter 2:**
"1. No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would..."

- **Valence:** 0.9 (Strong condemnation of perceived hypocrisy in the justice process related to police officers.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The point further emphasizes the speaker's authority to critique the system.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The expressive language amplifies the emotional weight of the hypocrisy argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Uses hypothetical scenarios to clarify the point, making it more relatable.)

**Quarter 3:**
"2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings..."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive implication that accountability could yield better behavior from officers.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker proposes a clear solution to the issue they raise.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Reasoned argument with a moderate intensity, suggesting a change in behavior.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concrete suggestion of the result of accountability but lacks detailed evidence.)

**Quarter 4:**
"3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with..."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Emphasizes fairness and justice, creating a strong emotional connection to victims' rights.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Continues the speaker’s critical stance but also presents a balanced view regarding officers.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong language depicts the strong emotional conflict between accountability and justice.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Provides specific reasoning and a strong framework for the argument, enhancing credibility.)

Overall, these scores reflect how effectively the argument conveys its message across different dimensions and sections.
