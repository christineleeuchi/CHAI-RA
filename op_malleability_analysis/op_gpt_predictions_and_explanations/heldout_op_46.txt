   - **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderately assertive)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderately intense)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Somewhat abstract, less concrete examples provided)

2. **Second Quarter: "Saying that open borders is a 'Koch Brothers Proposal' as though that in any way justifies treating people differently simply on the geographic location in which they were born is an absolutely abhorrent opinion..."**
   - **Valence:** 0.1 (Very negative)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (Very assertive)
   - **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some tangible ideas, but still somewhat abstract)

3. **Third Quarter: "... and I interpret it to mean that Bernie Sanders supports a bourgeois class of elitists who are only really different based on the fact that they were born in America."**

   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderately assertive)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately intense)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Somewhat abstract but references class distinction)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "No one has any choice over where they happen to be born, and people are *humans first*, regardless of where they are born. Discrimination based on where someone is born is *exactly equal* to racism."**
   - **Valence:** 0.4 (Somewhat negative due to the implication of racism)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderately assertive)
