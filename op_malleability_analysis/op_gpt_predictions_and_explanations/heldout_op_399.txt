Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument for each of the specified dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—let's break the argument into four quarters for evaluation:

**1st Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.2* - The tone is negative regarding women's combat roles.  
*Dominance: 0.7* - The speaker expresses a strong, dominant opinion.  
*Intensity: 0.6* - There's a moderate intensity in the phrasing used to express concerns about efficiency and operational focus.  
*Concreteness: 0.5* - Some concrete examples are provided, but they are general and not deeply detailed.

**2nd Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.1* - The valence remains negative, particularly about potential problems with women in combat.  
*Dominance: 0.8* - The dominance continues due to the assertive statement of beliefs around the differences between sexes.  
*Intensity: 0.7* - The argument feels more intense as it explicitly rejects contrary viewpoints.  
*Concreteness: 0.4* - General statements on appeals to discrimination are made, with less concrete examples.

**3rd Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.3* - There’s a slight shift with acknowledgment that the speaker has no personal animosity towards women.  
*Dominance: 0.6* - The tone is still assertive but slightly less domineering than previous sections.  
*Intensity: 0.5* - The intensity is moderate as the speaker defends their view against accusations of being “terrible.”  
*Concreteness: 0.5* - Some rationale is provided but remains mostly abstract.

**4th Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.2* - The tone returns to negative as the speaker concludes with the belief that women should not be in combat roles.  
*Dominance: 0.7* - The speaker remains firm in their stance.  
*Intensity: 0.8* - The intensity is high as the speaker summarizes their reasoning.  
*Concreteness: 0.6* - The conclusion is somewhat concrete but still relies on broader generalizations.

Overall, these ratings reflect the argument's tone, assertiveness, emotional strength, and grounding in concrete examples.
