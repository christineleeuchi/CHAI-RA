Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break down the assessment into four quarters of the text. Here are the scores along with brief explanations:

### First Quarter
**Valence: 0.3**  
The first portion introduces a provocative claim that can be seen as negative regarding those who contact suicide hotlines. It sets a controversial tone that may alienate some readers.

**Dominance: 0.6**  
The speaker expresses strong opinions, implying a level of authority on the subject due to personal experience, thus exhibiting a moderate level of dominance.

**Intensity: 0.7**  
The opening statements are quite intense, as they directly confront the notion of legitimacy about suicidal intent, likely evoking strong reactions.

**Concreteness: 0.4**  
While the argument presents a personal perspective, it lacks concrete definitions and examples at this stage, focusing more on abstract concepts like "legitimacy" without clear illustrations.

### Second Quarter
**Valence: 0.5**  
This section acknowledges that crisis hotlines help people, introducing a more neutral tone. It doesn't directly undermine those who are helped but emphasizes a distinction in the reasons for suicidal ideation.

**Dominance: 0.5**  
The speaker offers additional views but maintains a balance, explaining their definition and viewpoint without overwhelming dominance.

**Intensity: 0.5**  
The intensity decreases slightly as the speaker provides clarification and context, making the argument less confrontational.

**Concreteness: 0.6**  
The definitions provided about who is "legitimately suicidal" add some clarity, increasing the concreteness of the argument, though examples are still lacking.

### Third Quarter
**Valence: 0.4**  
The mention of personal experience and a critique of the effectiveness of hotlines provides a mixed valence, combining personal struggle with skepticism towards crisis interventions.

**Dominance: 0.5**  
The speaker maintains a level of confidence, grounded in their experiences but acknowledges a degree of uncertainty about their own feelings, which moderates the dominance.

**Intensity: 0.6**  
This section reflects emotional intensity as it revolves around serious themes of mental health and suicide, enhancing its emotional weight.

**Concreteness: 0.5**  
The argument remains somewhat abstract, discussing possibilities without concrete evidence or a clear narrative of experiences tied to hotline interactions.

### Fourth Quarter
**Valence: 0.3**  
In expressing the complexities of mental illness and consent, the tone becomes more somber and reflective, indicating a negative valence towards the acceptance of suicidal thoughts as rational.

**Dominance: 0.4**  
This portion shows a lesser degree of assertiveness as it discusses the philosophical implications of mental illness and consent, yielding to a more contemplative discussion.

**Intensity: 0.5**  
The intensity stabilizes as the discussion becomes more theoretical and less about personal conviction, returning to a more balanced tone.

**Concreteness: 0.5**  
While there are some deeper reflections on consent and rationality, the argument still lacks specific examples or data that could ground these discussions in observable reality.
