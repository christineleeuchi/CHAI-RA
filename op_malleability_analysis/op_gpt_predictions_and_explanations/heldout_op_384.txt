Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will provide ratings for each quarter of the text as follows:

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV:The things science cannot explain is not a reasonable place to put God. I am a former catholic and no longer believe in God. The argument I hear for proof of god is mainly in the things science can't explain. Something couldn't have come from nothing, dark matter, intelligent design, etc. This is nonsensical."

**Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment is generally negative towards the idea of using gaps in science to assert the existence of God.)

**Dominance:** 0.5 (There is a strong assertion of the speaker's viewpoint, but it is presented as a reasoned argument rather than an aggressive stance.)

**Intensity:** 0.6 (The use of phrases like "this is nonsensical" adds to the emotional intensity of the argument.)

**Concreteness:** 0.4 (While there are specific examples mentioned, they are presented in a more abstract manner regarding belief systems.)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** "You are essentially issuing in the same behavior ancient civilizations did. They could not understand at the time the weather, the sun, the cosmos, etc so it had to be God. All of the scriptures are written by people who had no such knowledge of the things They claimed to be God, and their lack of knowledge bleeds through as science unlocks more and more."

**Valence:** 0.2 (This section has a critical tone towards ancient beliefs and practices, reinforcing the author's skepticism about God.)

**Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument here is more dominant as it criticizes historical perspectives and draws a parallel with contemporary beliefs.)

**Intensity:** 0.7 (The comparison to ancient civilizations and their misunderstandings of the world conveys a strong sense of urgency and conviction.)

**Concreteness:** 0.5 (The references to ancient civilizations and historical scriptures give some concrete examples but remain somewhat abstract in their implications.)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "Now this is not to say God exists or does not exist. This is not my debate but my debate is where people are putting God. I think it quite possible to believe in God and also believe that science will shed light on the places it is the dark. Hence this post. To me is not reasonable in a world where people don't believe in God, or who believe in a different God, that putting on a label on the unexplainable is God. It is logical to put your faith, so to speak, in that science will explain these things in time, and that your belief in God belongs else where."

**Valence:** 0.5 (This part is more neutral, offering an exploration of belief rather than outright skepticism or affirmation.)

**Dominance:** 0.6 (The positioning of the argument in relation to where God should be placed shows a reflective dominance.)

**Intensity:** 0.5 (While there is a confident tone, it's less intense because it explores a middle ground regarding belief in science and God.)

**Concreteness:** 0.6 (This section includes more detailed reasoning about belief and science, contributing to its concreteness.)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "Now I also want to clarify to do the the things my debate touches on is not wrong, or immoral, it is simply unreasonable, not logical. I know there are many things that can give credence to your personal experiences and the deep thing inside most people there is more to this world than us. And that the proof of God is not a thing that can be measured in scientific terms. But I disagree that the universe, or multiverse, and all its contents cannot be explained by science, and it's not logical to put god here. Change my views"

**Valence:** 0.4 (There’s a mix of acknowledgment of personal experiences with critical reasoning, resulting in a mildly negative valence regarding placing God in scientific gaps.)

**Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts their views while leaving room for the perspectives of others.)

**Intensity:** 0.6 (The language “not wrong, or immoral” alongside “not logical” indicates a strong but measured tone.)

**Concreteness:** 0.5 (There are general statements about belief and science, giving some degree of specificity but still remaining somewhat open-ended.)
