Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the provided categories—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—let's break it into four quarters and assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each.

### Quarter 1:
"CMV: Your race should have no effect on your chances of getting into a good university. I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me."
- **Valence**: 0.3 (The tone is negative towards the current system but does not express outright hostility)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion and challenges the existing viewpoint)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Expresses frustration, but not in extreme terms)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Refers to a specific article but remains mostly abstract in its claims)

### Quarter 2:
"Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted)."
- **Valence**: 0.4 (Critique of affirmative action, but not aggressively negative)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Presents a clear alternative viewpoint)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (More analytical than emotional)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Discusses specific criteria for admission)

### Quarter 3:
"If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Stronger criticism of current practices)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Very assertive stance on the prioritization of grades)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (More passionate, especially with "completely useless" phrasing)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Provides an example comparing specific scores)

### Quarter 4:
"I believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree."
- **Valence**: 0.3 (Negative framing of affirmative action but suggests a belief in equality)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Reiterates strong opinions)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Maintains a critical but somewhat measured tone)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (References specific themes like intelligence and economic status)

### Summary of Scores:
1. **Quarter 1**: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
2. **Quarter 2**: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.6
3. **Quarter 3**: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
4. **Quarter 4**: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6

These evaluations reflect a balanced consideration of the speaker's argument throughout the passage while addressing nuances in tone, assertiveness, emotional weight, and the specificity of content.
