Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I will break down the argument text into four quarters and evaluate each one.

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: bitcoin is a digital version of a currency based on gold coins and share with it all the inequity. Hello everyone."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Neutral to slightly negative, due to mention of inequity)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Indicates a personal viewpoint but does not strongly assert authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Has some intensity with "inequity," but is mainly introductory)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some concrete terms like "bitcoin," "currency," but is vague in discussing inequity)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "First: I think that bitcoin can be compared to gold based currencies, because both the resources are used to create a currency and both are finite (bitcoin by design and the gold by the limit of the raw material actually known)."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it presents a comparison without emotional charge)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author states a comparative perspective but does not claim strong authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity in explaining the comparison)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (References specific concepts such as "gold-based currencies" and "finite resources")

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "Second: as gold advantaged the ones able to dig it (unless force was used), the same is for bitcoins. Who can mine more, has more economical power. That can be avoided with fiat currencies, where the distribution of purchasing power can be redistributed."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Slightly negative due to social inequities discussed)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (More authoritative in discussing the consequences of resource disparity)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (More intense as it discusses economic power and inequalities)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Very concrete with terms like "fiat currencies," "distribution of purchasing power")

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Disclaimer: bitcoin is a very cool system, even if it has the drawback to let people spend tons of energy/computing power on it, even if the energy (and blood) spent on gold until today should be way higher. Still, I do not like it (as well as gold based currencies) because I feel it intrinsically unfair."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative towards the end due to personal feelings on fairness)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (A mix of positive and negative; less authoritative at the end)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (High intensity due to the dual feelings expressed about bitcoin)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concrete in mentioning energy use and blood metaphor, yet somewhat vague on the fairness issue)

### Summary of Ratings
| Quarter   | Valence | Dominance | Intensity | Concreteness |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Quarter 1 | 0.2     | 0.3       | 0.4       | 0.5          |
| Quarter 2 | 0.5     | 0.4       | 0.5       | 0.6          |
| Quarter 3 | 0.3     | 0.5       | 0.7       | 0.7          |
| Quarter 4 | 0.2     | 0.4       | 0.6       | 0.6          |

These ratings reflect the emotional weight, authoritative presence, intensity of feelings, and the degree of specificity within each segment of the argument.
