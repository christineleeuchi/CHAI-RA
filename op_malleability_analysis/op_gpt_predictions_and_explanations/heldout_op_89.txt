Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I will break down the text into four segments and evaluate each aspect.

### Quarter 1: 
*"CMV: The number of sexual partners is more balanced across the board in men than in women. So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women **must** be the same."*

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral tone, stating a claim without positive or negative bias.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The use of "must" indicates confidence and a sense of authority over the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity due to the definitive language suggesting certainty.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The statement is abstract in its claim, lacking specific numerical evidence at this point.)

### Quarter 2:
*"However, the median can be different."*

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral—just presenting an alternative point.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (No strong assertion is made; it’s more of a caveat.)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Low intensity; this statement is calm and understated.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (While it suggests a concept, it lacks specificity at this stage.)

### Quarter 3:
*"According to the CDC, the median number of **opposite-sex** partners in a lifetime is **6.6** for men, and **4.3** for women. Basic mathematics concludes this: Take two sets of numbers (set M and set F). M and F have the same mean, but F has a smaller median than M."*

- **Valence**: 0.6 (Positive in terms of the argument's support through data, but could be seen as negative towards women.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (High authority due to the citation of a reputable statistic and a logical structure.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Strong intensity, especially with definitive language regarding mathematical conclusions.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Highly concrete due to specific numbers and data from the CDC.)

### Quarter 4:
*"Therefore, the numbers in M are more balanced across the board than the numbers in F. What I mean by this is that, according to the data, promiscuous women are **more promiscuous** than promiscuous men, and celibate women are **more celibate** than celibate men. Math never lies, but feel free to change my view."*

- **Valence**: 0.6 (While it is analytical, it may carry a negative connotation towards women due to the comparison.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Maintains a strong concluding stance based on data.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (Higher intensity as it seeks to assert a strong conclusion derived from the argument.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Combines specific data with broader claims, enhancing the concrete nature of the argument.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Quarter 1**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 2**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.4
- **Quarter 3**: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.9
- **Quarter 4**: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.8
