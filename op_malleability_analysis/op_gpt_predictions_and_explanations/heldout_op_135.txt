Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument provided, I will rate the four dimensions: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. These ratings will be on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the four quarters of the argument.

**1st Quarter:**
"CMV: The Palestinians had the moral high ground (or at least parity) for statehood back in 1948, but have since lost it after decades of terrorism fueled by antisemitism. 1. Israel has repeatedly been on the defense in wars with her neighbors, only making aggressive maneuvers after repelling the invaders. Israel has usually given most of the captured land back to the aggressors as an olive branch in good faith."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed feelings; acknowledges historical injustice but leans towards negative perception of Palestinians)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion on the moral standing of both parties)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a strong sense of conviction in the phrasing)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some specific historical references, but also broad statements that might lack evidence)

**2nd Quarter:**
"2. Israel treats her Palestinian citizens as full citizens, even holding public office. Religious freedom is the standard, as are most civil liberties expected of a civilized liberal democracy in the 21st century."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive portrayal of Israel’s treatment of its citizens)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderate authority in presenting Israel’s positive attributes)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Fairly firm claim but with room for counterarguments)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific claims about civil liberties and political participation, though still generalized)

**3rd Quarter:**
"3. Israel exercises an extraordinary effort and restraint when engaging Palestinian terrorists in combat by warning innocents to leave an area they are about to bomb. It is impossible to avoid all civilian deaths, but at least they seriously try."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Positive view of Israel’s military conduct but recognizes civilian casualties)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong assertion of Israel's restraint in military operations)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Firmly stated, suggesting a high level of belief in the claim)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Claims are somewhat vague without specifics on the warning systems or data about civilian casualties)

**4th Quarter:**
"4. In contrast, Palestinians, namely Hamas are foundationally (in their founding charter) committed to killing as many Jews and Israelis as they can, at any cost, as seen by their relentless attack on southern Israel with rockets and raids."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Very negative portrayal of Hamas, which may evoke strong feelings)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong criticism directed at Hamas, presenting them as the primary aggressors)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (Very intense language and framing of Hamas's intentions)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear reference to Hamas’s charter and their military actions)

In summary, the ratings reflect that the argument has a very polarized tone where it presents a favorable view of Israel and a critical view of Hamas, showcasing strong convictions but also providing a mix of specific details and broader claims.
