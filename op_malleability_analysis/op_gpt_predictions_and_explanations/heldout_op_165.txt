Sure! Here’s a rating for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### 1st Quarter (from the start to "natural selection would have followed its natural course.")

- **Valence**: 0.3 (The sentiment is somewhat negative towards the preservation of pandas, focusing on costs and the idea of extinction being natural.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The author is assertively presenting their viewpoint and striving to persuade the reader.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (There's a strong emphasis on disagreement, but it's not at the peak of emotional intensity yet.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (There are abstract concepts (natural selection) but also some concrete elements regarding cost.)

### 2nd Quarter (from "I would like someone..." to "...change my opinion on the preservation of these animals.")

- **Valence**: 0.4 (A neutral tone is introduced, indicating a search for dialogue rather than complete negativity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The author shows willingness to consider other viewpoints, indicating an openness that softens their dominance.)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (This part has lower emotional intensity as it's focused more on seeking dialogue than expressing strong feelings.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (There is a clear expression of desire to engage in discussion, which adds clarity.)

### 3rd Quarter (from "Panda bears are being..." to "...they are so fat they can't have sex.")

- **Valence**: 0.2 (Strongly negative comments about panda bears make this section low on valence.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The argument is dominant here, firmly asserting an opinion about panda bears’ qualities and issues.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The language becomes harsher, conveying frustration and strong opinions, boosting intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Concrete statements about pandas’ reproductive behaviors and habitat destruction provide clarity.)

### 4th Quarter (from "I say let natural selection..." to the end.)

- **Valence**: 0.3 (The conclusion maintains a negative stance, advocating for a lack of intervention.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Although the author is confident in their viewpoint, there is also a hint of reflection in considering the responses they've received.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The intensity is moderate here; it’s assertive but doesn’t escalate further.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The call to redirect funds to more worthy causes offers a concrete suggestion.)

These scores reflect the emotional and rhetorical qualities of each section of the argument.
