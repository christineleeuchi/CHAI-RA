Sure, here's a breakdown of the argument's text into four quarters, along with a rating score for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter.

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: I was born in 1979. I do't believe there has been a single war in my lifetime that was fought to protect my freedom. Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc..."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone is somewhat negative, expressing skepticism about the wars and their purpose.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker takes a position but is open to discussion, indicating a neutral dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (There is a mild intensity; the speaker feels strongly about the topic but does not express extreme emotions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The mention of specific wars makes the argument more tangible and concrete.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "I hear talk all the time about how soldiers are protecting our freedom and I swear I'm not being rhetorical when I say, 'Has any war fought in my lifetime protected my freedom or me and my family?'"

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The aspect of questioning indicates skepticism but maintains respect for soldiers.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a questioning stance, challenging the prevailing narrative.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The use of "I swear" adds intensity, reflecting the speaker's frustration.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The question posed is specific and personal, making it more relatable.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "I have a huge respect for our military men and women. Regardless of why they're sent into battle, I believe that they deserve my respect. I want to respect the REASONS they are sent into battle, but with the knowledge I have, I just can't."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive tone with respect for military personnel, but mixed with internal conflict.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker positions themselves as respectful yet conflicted, showing openness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The intensity increases due to the internal struggle expressed.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is personal but somewhat abstract, especially in terms of "reasons" for war.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "I believe we use our military to protect the US's oil interests and quite honestly, there's a lot of money to be made in the private sector selling war machines and munitions."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative tone, suggesting manipulation and exploitation of military efforts for profit.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong viewpoint regarding military use and corruption.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity due to the strong accusations made about the motivations behind war.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument references specific interests and industries, adding a level of detail.)
