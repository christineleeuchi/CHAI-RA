Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here are the rating scores for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1:
**Text**: "CMV: Some cultures have better cuisine than others For food, I think there are some core fundamentals that nearly everyone (or at least a theoretical judge with no country of origin bias) can agree on: - Fresh quality ingredients - Variety (be it from flavors, spices, texture, combinations of ingredients) - Visually appealing presentation (highly subjective, but the food photography industry shows at least some core preferences)"

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The argument presents a positive view of cuisine based on certain criteria, but it somewhat implies that some cuisines are less favorable.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The author is expressing a personal viewpoint while acknowledging a theoretical objective judge, suggesting a balance of opinion.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The language is measured; it expresses beliefs but without extreme emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The argument employs tangible criteria, making the points easy to grasp, though some abstract concepts exist.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text**: "With that premise, some culture's cuisines simply lend themselves better to these metrics and could be considered objectively better."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (This part positively asserts that some cuisines are inherently better, which is a strong position.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (There’s a clear assertion of superiority, which indicates a bit more dominance in viewpoint.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (This is more assertive than the first quarter, as it communicates a strong belief in the argument's premise.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.3 (The concept of "better" is subjective and not clearly defined here, reducing its concreteness.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text**: "For example, I think many iconic Vietnamese dishes hit all these notes. While another culture's heavy reliance on deep frying or fermented fish may not."

- **Valence**: 0.8 (Uses a positive example of Vietnamese cuisine contrasted against a negative attribute of another, adding favorable bias.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (It continues from the earlier dominance but isn’t overly forceful, making a comparison instead.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (While it presents clear examples, it is still informed and acknowledges diversity in preparation.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Specific examples help ground the argument somewhat but are still somewhat abstract in the evaluation of “better.”)

### Quarter 4:
**Text**: "That's not to say every dish from a specific culture is bad or a specific method of preparation is bad (I LOVE FRENCH FRIES) but on average, and to an objective judge, you can objectively rank a few culture's food over another's. EDIT: You guys have helped identify my core bias that I would like removed: I simply don't believe that Siberian food can be as intricate as say Italian food. I simply think it's no coincidence that Italian restaurants are much more popular than Irish restaurants. And that Italian cuisine would still rank higher than most to a panel of the most impartial randomly selected unbiased judges you could create."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Acknowledges personal bias and counterexamples, which moderates the earlier positive claims somewhat.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (This quarter has a more assertive tone towards specific cuisines, particularly Italian, showing a stronger personal belief.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The language is more passionate, especially with the personal preference stated, enhancing intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The examples of restaurant popularity provide some specifics, but the concept of "intricacy" remains subjective.)

These scores reflect the varying degrees of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness across the argument as it progresses.
