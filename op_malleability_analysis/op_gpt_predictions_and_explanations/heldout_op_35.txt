To provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each aspect of the argument in each quarter of the text, we can break it down as follows:

**1st Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.1* - The sentiment is negative, as it expresses hopelessness about treatment effectiveness.
*Dominance: 0.6* - The speaker expresses a strong personal experience and viewpoint, indicating a degree of control over their narrative.
*Intensity: 0.7* - The emotions conveyed are quite strong, particularly when discussing misery and hopelessness.
*Concreteness: 0.4* - There are specific references to experiences (medication, self-help books), but the abstract idea of brain chemistry lacks tangible examples.

**2nd Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.1* - Continues to maintain a negative sentiment focused on chronic misery.
*Dominance: 0.7* - The speaker asserts a strong perspective on their condition and experience.
*Intensity: 0.8* - High emotional intensity is evident as the speaker describes a long-term struggle with depression.
*Concreteness: 0.5* - More specific references to personal experience deepen the argument, yet still not entirely grounded in specifics.

**3rd Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.0* - The tone is extremely negative, indicating a deep sense of hopelessness.
*Dominance: 0.7* - The speaker maintains control over the narrative and the idea of comparison to diabetes is a strong assertion.
*Intensity: 0.9* - The emotional weight is very high here, emphasizing despair.
*Concreteness: 0.6* - The comparability to diabetes adds some tangible realism to the abstract notion of depression.

**4th Quarter:**
*Valence: 0.2* - Although predominantly negative, there is a hint of openness towards others who may relate, which offers a slight positive twist.
*Dominance: 0.5* - The speaker presents a question, which reduces the assertiveness compared to earlier sections.
*Intensity: 0.6* - The mention of alcohol provides a less intense emotional response but still reflects underlying issues.
*Concreteness: 0.4* - The desire for connection and potential solutions is mentioned, which is somewhat concrete but remains abstract in terms of actionable steps.

Overall, this breakdown highlights the persistent struggle within the text while illustrating the gradation of emotions and thematic elements throughout the argument.
