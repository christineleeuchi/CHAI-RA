Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument using the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here are the ratings for each quarter of the text:

### Quarter 1: "CMV: Music artists/bands should not release singles from their upcoming albums. Whenever I get really excited for a band's new album, I always listen to the singles to death and by the time the album comes out, I'm sick of those songs I can't experience the album as one complete piece of work."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (The sentiment is largely negative as the author expresses frustration about being "sick" of the songs.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The author presents their view confidently, but it reflects a personal experience rather than an authoritative stance.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The author's excitement and frustration contribute to a moderate intensity in expressing their feelings.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The use of specific experiences and feelings makes the argument quite concrete.)

### Quarter 2: "And I know this is true of lots of people, not just myself. As much as I would like to simply not listen to singles, it's just too tempting when I've been craving new music from a band for two years."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (There's still some frustration, but the mention of collective experience softens the negativity slightly.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The acknowledgment of shared feelings gives it a more relatable aspect but does not increase authority.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity is maintained as the author expresses a common internal conflict.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The personal craving for new music adds to the concrete nature of their feelings.)

### Quarter 3: "I think artists should instead release a couple of teasers, that way people can get a taste for the sound of the new material, but without being completely exposed to a full song and potentially ruining the experience."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (This section is more positive as it suggests a possible solution to the issue raised earlier.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The author asserts their opinion about what artists should do, indicating more authority in this part.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (While there is a positive suggestion, the intensity isnâ€™t very high compared to the personal experience shared previously.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The proposal for teasers is a clear and concrete suggestion.)

### Quarter 4: "I also hate the current trend of streaming new albums a week before release dates. It really kills the anticipation, and it sucks when I pre-order music and everyone who didn't gets to listen to it early. If you crack and just listen to the stream, then you won't be as excited to listen to your copy for the first time when you finally get it."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (The tone is predominantly negative, particularly with phrases like "it sucks".)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The author expresses dissatisfaction with a trend but maintains a personal perspective rather than an authoritative one.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (This part expresses strong emotions regarding the anticipation of new music, indicating a higher intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The argument is concrete, providing specific examples related to the experience of music releases.)

These ratings aim to capture the essence of the argument and how it evolves throughout the text.
