Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument on the scales of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here's a breakdown for each quarter of the provided text:

### Quarter 1
**Text:**
"CMV: Superman should not have been able to beat Zod in Man of Steel. Taking the existence of super-powered aliens as a given, I think the most unrealistic part of Man of Steel was Superman standing any chance against Zod."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive and negative emotions are somewhat balanced as the user critiques the film's realism)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument presents a personal view without asserting an overwhelming authoritative stance)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The author expresses a strong opinion regarding the film's realism)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument presents a broad assertion but lacks specific evidence or details at this stage)

### Quarter 2
**Text:**
"Zod was basically trained from birth to be the ultimate killer. He was the product of generations of eugenics to create the perfect fighter. He was his people's greatest military commander."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (A strong negative tone is directed towards Superman’s abilities in contrast to Zod’s background)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument here is more assertive, establishing Zod's superior training)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The language used conveys a significant conviction about Zod's unmatched skills)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This section provides specific details about Zod’s background and training)

### Quarter 3
**Text:**
"Superman was physically stronger than the average person of his race for having grown up in the 'nutrient-rich environment' of Earth. But he grew up on a farm and received no formal training. He had only barely started to have a mastery of his abilities by the time Zod and his followers arrived."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone remains critical of Superman but is more neutral regarding his upbringing)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (This section offers a balanced perspective, not favoring either side strongly)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is an emphasis on Superman's lack of training, but it is not as forceful as prior sections)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Provides concrete context for Superman's background and its implications)

### Quarter 4
**Text:**
"Zod and his people were initially shocked by their newfound strength on Earth, but they quickly adapted. He achieved a similar power level to Superman in a matter of days, in addition to his previous training and skills. The advantage in sheer strength of Superman should not have been enough to overpower Zod. It is basically like putting a Navy Seal against a body-builder. The body-builder may be physically stronger, but he's still going to get his ass kicked."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The valence is neutral overall, providing a hypothetical analogy that illustrates a point)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (This section presents a strong assertion regarding the outcome of the fight)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The analogy strengthens the impact of the argument)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Realistic comparisons and analogies are presented, providing clarity to the argument)

### Summary of Scores:

| Quarter      | Valence | Dominance | Intensity | Concreteness |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Quarter 1    | 0.7     | 0.5       | 0.6       | 0.5          |

| Quarter 3    | 0.6     | 0.5       | 0.6       | 0.7          |
| Quarter 4    | 0.5     | 0.7       | 0.8       | 0.8          |
