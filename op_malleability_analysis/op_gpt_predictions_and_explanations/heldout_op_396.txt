Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To analyze the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will provide scores for each quarter of the text, rated from 0.0 to 1.0. Here is my assessment:

### 1st Quarter
**Text**: "CMV: Anyone who believes that inflicting physical pain or death on an adult as punishment for a perceived wrongdoing believes in revenge, not justice. Whilst browsing Reddit, I come across comments with surprising popularity that endorse the idea that people who have committed a crime are fully deserving of a physical punishment, often carried out by someone acting on the interests of the victim, regardless of what the law has to say on the matter. Posts talking about fathers beating up boys who cheat on their daughter, or killing a man who drove drunk and killed their son in the process, often receive support following the idea that ‘they totally deserved it, they were awful people’."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (Negative sentiment due to the topic of violence and punishment)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The author asserts a strong position against the notion of revenge-based punishment)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity, presenting strong opinions but not overly aggressive)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Some abstract concepts but includes specific examples of punishments)

### 2nd Quarter
**Text**: "I feel that this is a barbaric way of looking at things. Many people seem to be of the opinion that ‘an eye for an eye’ is the best form of justice, that it settles all disputes. This person killed someone, so we should kill them. That person cheated, they should get beaten up. Fair is fair right?"

- **Valence**: 0.3 (Negative sentiment in labeling the viewpoint as barbaric)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Continues to assert a strong stance against the punitive mindset)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Slightly higher intensity with emotional language like "barbaric")
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (References specific acts of violence, more concrete than the first quarter)

### 3rd Quarter
**Text**: "But that’s just revenge, defined as ‘the action of hurting or harming someone in return for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands’. Does a person who cheated, whilst it is an undeniably awful breach of trust, deserve to receive physical punishment for their actions? The aggrieved might think so, but I find it incredible that even people who are not directly involved are not reasonable enough to admit that this shouldn’t happen."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (Negative but also includes a questioning tone that opens dialogue)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Maintains an assertive tone but begins to invite contemplation)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate intensity, focusing on the questioning nature of the argument)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Uses a specific definition of revenge that lends more concrete meaning)

### 4th Quarter
**Text**: "In more serious cases, such as murder, I still do not believe that the perpetrator’s death can bring about anything other than brief respite for the aggrieved. I understand that people feel that killing a murderer improves society by their absence, but I believe that whilst idealistic, the method of attempted rehabilitation is preferable (and actually is cheaper, if that should be a factor at all) than killing the person. I don’t think a person forfeits their human rights by breaching those of another, as doing so would make those in charge of their fate act as the accused has acted. The punishment for a crime should not be decided by the victim or those with the victim’s interests at heart, and such actions should not be celebrated. Instead, a group of unbiased individuals who can make their decision based on justice should decide, not revenge."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Balanced perspective that is less negative, includes advocacy for rehabilitation)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strongly argues for an alternative view of justice and rehabilitation)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Stronger language advocating for justice reform)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Concretely discusses rehabilitation and human rights in the context of punishment)

These scores reflect a nuanced evaluation based on the specific characteristics of each section of the argument. Overall, the argument presents a critical stance against revenge-based punishment while advocating for a more rehabilitative approach to justice.
