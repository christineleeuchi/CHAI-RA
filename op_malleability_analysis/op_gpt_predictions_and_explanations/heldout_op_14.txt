- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; the statement is a personal opinion, not overly positive or negative)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Somewhat lower; the speaker acknowledges potential oversight)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate; the speaker shows some conviction but is cautious)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Moderate; mentions a personal stance but lacks specific examples)

### Quarter 2:

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "...So basically, aside from people for whom money is truly no object and I suppose people with pathological fears of sitting where others have sat, I just can't imagine any good reason for the average Joe with a limited budget and no debilitating phobias to buy a new car."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Slightly negative; touches on irrational fears, but the main point is practical)
