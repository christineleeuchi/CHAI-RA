Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument using the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the text.

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: Race is not a real thing, it's not science, yet it is stuck in pop culture and every time it's used the amount of suffering in the world increases..."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The tone is negative, focusing on the harmful consequences of the concept of race.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument asserts a strong position against the validity of race as a concept.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument demonstrates a strong emotional stance regarding the negative impact of race.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it introduces the subject, it remains somewhat abstract in discussing the concept of race.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "...Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits..."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This section has a more neutral tone, but it acknowledges the flawed nature of racial categories.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (While it presents important information, it does not strongly assert a new point; instead, it builds on previous arguments.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (This part is more descriptive and less emotionally charged compared to the first quarter.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It provides specific information about the historical development of race as a concept, adding to its clarity.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "Race is a scientific theory its technical description is biological essentialism. That theory has been proved incorrect and is no longer considered a reasonable category..."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone remains critical of race, describing it as incorrect and obsolete.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (This section is assertive, presenting a strong refutation of biological essentialism as a valid scientific category.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The emotional intensity is high regarding the disapproval of race as a scientific concept.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (It is concrete in its claims about biological essentialism and its rejection by modern science.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "There are many reasons to keep unscientific or illogical descriptions, or to tell stories which are not real, I am not calling for an end to them all, some are fun..."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (This section adopts a more balanced tone, recognizing the existence of fictional stories without causing harm.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (It shifts to a more reflective tone, thus reducing its assertiveness relative to previous sections.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (This part has a lower emotional charge, highlighting the need for a distinction between harmful and harmless narratives.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (It introduces a concept that is somewhat abstract but provides a rationale for the existence of certain narrative forms.)

In summary:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.5
