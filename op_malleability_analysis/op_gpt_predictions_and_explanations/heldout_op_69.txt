Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score for each quarter of the argument based on the specified dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), I'll break the argument into four segments and assess each accordingly.

**1st Quarter: "CMV: Red lights should be treated like stop signs when no one is around. You cannot prove that deterring this behavior would protect people. At least until an experiment is ran."**

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument presents a perspective that can be seen as practical, but it also introduces a level of skepticism towards current rules.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The tone is assertive in suggesting a change but doesn't overpower the reader; it presents an opinion rather than a command.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument is moderate in intensity; it suggests a change but does not express strong emotions towards any outcome.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument is concrete in its suggestion and provides a clear proposal for evaluation.)

**2nd Quarter: "Where I live it is legal to turn right at a red light after fully stopping and looking out for traffic. There are some intersections where it doesn't work well and I concede my idea would primarily only work well at small intersections or late at night."**

- **Valence:** 0.7 (This section provides a practical perspective that is generally positive and rational.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (There's less assertiveness here as the speaker acknowledges limitations, indicating a more open-minded approach.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (This part is less intense, focusing on context and limitations rather than strong emotions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (It presents specific legal situations and acknowledges exceptions, making it concrete in terms of applicability.)

**3rd Quarter: "Red lights should be improved to minimize waiting but behavior like I suggest would prioritize this technology."**

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The suggestion to improve red lights is positive and forward-thinking.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (While it suggests a beneficial change, it doesn't dominate the discussion, as it remains a part of a broader argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (This part has moderate intensity, highlighting a proactive suggestion without aggressive language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The call for improvements is clear and specific, but the idea of prioritizing technologies is a bit abstract.)

**4th Quarter: "Traffic circles would also solve this problem and I believe my idea would only promote more traffic circles to be built in large intersections where my idea would work poorly."**

- **Valence:** 0.7 (This section maintains a generally positive outlook on traffic circles as a solution.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It presents another solution without making it the central focus, showing balanced reasoning.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There's a clear preference for traffic circles, which adds some intensity to the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The mention of traffic circles is specific but somewhat less immediate compared to earlier sections; it's a proposed solution but not fully fleshed out.)

Overall, the argument flows through a series of logical suggestions, transitioning from a clear claim to concrete examples, while remaining reasonably balanced in terms of emotional tone.
