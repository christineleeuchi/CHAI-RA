**Quarter 1:**
*Argument:* Introduction of the viewpoint regarding Greece's financial crisis as a defeat for Left & Socialist politics.

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The sentiment is largely negative towards Left politics, indicating a defeat which has a negative connotation.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author presents a strong opinion, indicating a dominance in their viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a moderate level of intensity; the author is passionate but not overly aggressive.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is somewhat abstract as it refers to political ideologies rather than specific actions or events.)

**Quarter 2:**
*Argument:* Expressing the belief that spending within means is a moral obligation and critique of Tsipras.

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The sentiment remains negative towards Tsipras's actions, viewing them as reckless and cynical.)
