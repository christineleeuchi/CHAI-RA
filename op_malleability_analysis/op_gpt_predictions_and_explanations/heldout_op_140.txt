Here are the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the provided argument, broken down into four quarters:

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument presents a controversial perspective, evoking mixed feelings about extreme hunting and omnivorism.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument takes a strong stance against the public shaming of extreme hunters, positing that omnivores are equally culpable.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The language reflects a moderate intensity, using rhetorical questions to provoke thought.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (References to specific individuals and concepts provide some concrete examples, but much of the argument is abstract.)

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (This section presents a more philosophical discussion, which may engage some readers while alienating others.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument maintains a clear position but engages in speculation which softens its dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (While there are provocative thoughts, the wording and tone remain relatively calm.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The hypotheticals presented lack concrete instances, leaning more on abstract reasoning.)

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Questions about moral reactions and comparisons evoke stronger emotional responses.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument challenges prevalent views, reinforcing its position while recognizing counterarguments.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The content is directed towards challenging societal norms, leading to heightened intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While concepts are illustrated through comparisons, they remain abstract in nature.)

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The exploration of public perceptions is interesting and may invoke a sense of moral complexity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument also recognizes a potential shift in societal norms, which tempers its dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Questions posed in this section resonate with moral dilemmas, heightening intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (References to specific scenarios (like lab-grown meat) provide more tangible grounding for the final remarks.)
