Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To analyze the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break it down into four quarters and provide a score (0.0 to 1.0) for each aspect.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: I find it very irresponsible of the LGBT community to create videos about being bullied and showing it around. I would like to apologize in advance if this has appeared in the subreddit before."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment is negative regarding the LGBT community's actions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker expresses their opinion forcefully but is also apologetic.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The words "very irresponsible" suggest a moderate level of intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The mention of videos is concrete, but the argument remains abstract in nature.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "I am 100% for the LGBT community, and have several friends who are part of it (who also got mad at me when I poorly attempted to explain this)."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (This portion reveals positive sentiments towards the LGBT community.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker is neutral, mostly supportive, and slightly submissive.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The phrase "100% for the LGBT community" is strong but tempered by self-reflection.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The mention of "friends" provides a personal, relatable touch.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "I sort of imagine this as being similar to slavery, imagine; a slave creates a documentary interviewing other slaves about how poorly they are treated, then show it in theatres where slavery is outlawed."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This comparison can be seen as negative and controversial, which may stir discomfort.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The analogy is quite strong and aims to dominate the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (This analogy uses powerful imagery, elevating the intensity significantly.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The scenario is concrete, painted vividly to illustrate the speaker's point.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "I find it irresponsible of them to ask anyone, let alone those who do nothing, to solve their problems for them... Also, if it sounds like I'm being an asshole, I apologize, but this is what I think, and that's why I'm on CMV."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The sentiment is predominantly negative towards the LGBT community's approach.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker presents a strong opinion with a sense of finality.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The language is more assertive; it conveys frustration and a call to action.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some abstract references and appeals diminish the concreteness of the claims.)

### Summary Scores
1. **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.4
2. **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.5
3. **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.6
4. **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5

These scores reflect the emotional quality, assertiveness, emotional weight, and clarity of the original statements in each segment of the argument.
