Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the specified dimensions of the argument, broken down into four quarters:

### 1st Quarter (Introduction and Alcohol):
- **Valence**: 0.7 – The argument presents a positive view of apples while challenging the notion of the "apples vs oranges" comparison. There’s a clear bias towards apples, framing them as superior.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 – The argument positions apples as the dominant fruit in terms of versatility in alcoholic beverages, although it acknowledges orange use as well.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 – The argument is moderately intense, with a mix of factual claims and subjective opinions, particularly regarding the quality of orange wines.
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 – The argument gives concrete examples (like cider and apple beer) to support its claims, but more statistical data or specific instances could strengthen it.

### 2nd Quarter (Food):
- **Valence**: 0.8 – The argument is very positive about apples, highlighting cultural associations (like apple pie) and calling out the lack of versatility with oranges.
- **Dominance**: 0.7 – Apples are presented as the clear choice for culinary applications, particularly in American culture, establishing a strong dominance narrative.
- **Intensity**: 0.6 – This section maintains a strong opinion, although it doesn't get highly emotional. Some humor is used, which adds to the intensity slightly.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 – The specific references to apple pie and cooking with apples provide solid support but would benefit from more examples of orange usage in food.

### 3rd Quarter (Diversity and Juice):
- **Valence**: 0.7 – The argument maintains a favorable view of apples by citing their variety, which contributes positively to their reputation.
- **Dominance**: 0.8 – The sheer number of apple varieties presented creates a strong argument for apples’ dominance over oranges.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 – This section is less intense, feeling more factual and straightforward rather than persuasive or emotional.
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 – Clear statistics about variety and details about juice products make this section strong in terms of concrete information.

### 4th Quarter (Pop Culture):
- **Valence**: 0.9 – This part of the argument leans heavily into the positive aspects of apples, connecting them to iconic symbols and the tech company Apple.
- **Dominance**: 0.8 – The cultural references (e.g., Johnny Appleseed, Forrest Gump’s quote) strongly suggest apples have a greater impact on culture and society.
- **Intensity**: 0.7 – There is a playful, engaging tone that adds to the intensity, making the claims feel more dynamic and entertaining.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 – While the cultural references are effective, they could be strengthened by additional examples or details relating to the impact of oranges.
