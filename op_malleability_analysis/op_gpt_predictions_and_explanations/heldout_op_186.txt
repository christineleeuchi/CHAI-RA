To evaluate the argument based on the four dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), the following scores can be assigned to each quarter of the text:

### 1. Valence (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Score: 0.3**
  - The overall tone of the argument is negative, discussing violent actions and associating evolution with harmful ideologies. It reflects a viewpoint that perceives evolution as a dangerous concept.

### 2. Dominance (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Score: 0.6**
  - The argument's style is assertive, as it attempts to make a strong case for removing evolution from schools based on its perceived negative consequences. The author portrays a sense of authority in presenting their reasoning, despite acknowledging some level of doubt.

### 3. Intensity (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Score: 0.7**
  - The use of charged language regarding serious topics (e.g., eugenics, the Holocaust) amplifies the emotional intensity of the argument. The author emphasizes the severity of their claims, which seeks to invoke a strong response from the audience.

### 4. Concreteness (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Score: 0.5**
  - There are specific references made (e.g., Columbine shooters, artificial selection, historical context of eugenics), providing a degree of concreteness. However, the connections drawn may be perceived as abstract or tenuous, impacting the overall clarity of the argument.
