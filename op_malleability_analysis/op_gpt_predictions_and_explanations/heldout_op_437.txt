Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we will analyze each quarter of the argument text. The scale will be from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents very low presence of that characteristic, and 1.0 represents very high presence.

### 1st Quarter:
**Text**: "CMV: Sex and Violence should be treated with equal standards. You know what really turns my gears, the fact that here in the US you can get scolded by the populous for putting a sexual undertone in your creation (in adult media outside of porn) while you get praise for putting a lot of action and violence in what you're creating."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative due to frustration expressed)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker is expressing a strong opinion, indicating a degree of authority)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity in expressing strong feelings about the issue)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Uses specific examples like "adult media" and "violence," making it fairly concrete)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text**: "I personally think that how the general populous' craving for violence while hating on sexual themes is very counter-productive (at least here in the US). I believe how we got this mind set is how violence and sex was perceived back in the Victorian Era where multiple wars were happening within the US and how the upper class thought of nudity as a 'lower class' trait."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Continues the mixed sentiment, maintaining a critical lens)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The historical context lends to the speakerâ€™s authority)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The critique of societal norms carries significant emotional weight)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Historical aspects provide context but are somewhat abstract)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text**: "This carried over into World War 1 and 2 where violence pretty much saved the US and made it into the giant economy it was and still mostly is today. And also during the Cold War, religion (mainly Christianity where sex is pretty much looked down especially with Homosexuality) was taking over and the US population perceived Russia as a 'Communist Atheist' county."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (Negative connotations regarding violence and sex)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Balanced in terms of historical narrative but still conveying a clear viewpoint)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderately intense focus on historical impact)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Specific references to historical events enhance concreteness)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text**: "This old mindset has to stop and thus we need to move on into a more accepting culture. And I'm not talking about 'Oh let's just legalize Pedophilia and Bestiality', I'm talking about treating sexual themes and violence in the same matter. Also I don't believe we should expose younger children to sexual themes as the same matter with extreme violence within our media."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (Strongly negative declaration about past mindsets)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (Assertive stance promoting cultural change)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (High intensity in advocating for a shift in societal norms)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Clear positions on sensitive topics, though one aspect is extreme and speculative)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **1st Quarter**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
- **2nd Quarter**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6
