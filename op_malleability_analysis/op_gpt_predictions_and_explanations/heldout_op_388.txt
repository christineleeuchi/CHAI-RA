Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here are the ratings for each of the four quarters of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence: 0.5** - The argument presents a balanced perspective, introducing the idea without extreme positivity or negativity. It aims to foster a discussion rather than make definitive claims.
- **Dominance: 0.4** - The author presents their viewpoint firmly but acknowledges counterarguments, indicating a moderate level of dominance in the discussion.
- **Intensity: 0.6** - The tone is assertive, especially when discussing evidence and counterclaims, creating a higher intensity in the first quarter.
- **Concreteness: 0.5** - The use of examples (like weight classes in boxing) provides some concrete details, but the overall proposal remains somewhat abstract without specifics on how classes would be defined.

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence: 0.4** - There is a slight shift towards a more critical tone responding to counterarguments, which influences the overall positivity.
- **Dominance: 0.6** - The author directly counters opposing views, showing increased confidence and presenting a stronger position in this quarter.
- **Intensity: 0.7** - The author’s passion for the subject increases, especially with references to notable athletes like Serena Williams, amplifying the intensity of the argument.
- **Concreteness: 0.5** - While the author references specific athletes and outcomes, the lack of precise criteria for the proposed classes leaves it somewhat abstract.

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence: 0.3** - The tone becomes more defensive in response to criticisms, which reduces the overall positivity.
- **Dominance: 0.5** - The author engages with critiques without overly dominating the conversation, maintaining a balance of viewpoints.
- **Intensity: 0.6** - The engagement with potential counterarguments suggests a level of urgency and intensity in defending the main thesis.
- **Concreteness: 0.6** - The acknowledgment of various factors (like muscle mass, coordination) demonstrates concrete thinking but lacks specific data or studies to support claims.

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence: 0.5** - This section maintains a neutral to positive tone as it invites further discussion and encourages optimism about the proposal.
- **Dominance: 0.4** - The author expresses some vulnerability in acknowledging the difficulty of proving their points, which influences their dominance.
- **Intensity: 0.5** - There’s a moderate intensity as the author summarizes and reflects, but it feels less urgent than the previous sections.
- **Concreteness: 0.6** - The author's suggestions for class creation (e.g., height-based classes) lend a degree of concreteness, but the lack of empirical backing still limits it.

Overall, the argument demonstrates a spectrum of engagement, with variations in tone and strength of presentation across its quarters.
