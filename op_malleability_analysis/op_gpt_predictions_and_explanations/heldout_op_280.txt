Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break it down into four quarters, providing scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each aspect.

### Quarter 1:
"CMV: Elders do not deserve respect So, this will be hard to pad out, as it is the absence of a thing. Basically, we've all heard that we should respect our elders."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment is largely negative regarding respect for elders, but not overtly aggressive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker is asserting their viewpoint, but there's an acknowledgment of a broader societal expectation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There's a moderate intensity to the claim, although it doesn't express extreme emotion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The argument introduces the topic but lacks specific examples or evidence in this section.)

---

### Quarter 2:
"The only real reason seems to be because *they are older*. This seems like a really flawed basis for deserving respect."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The tone remains critical, but it is more analytical than outright dismissive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is firmly in control of their argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There’s a stronger assertiveness in this part of the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (This section is more focused than the first, but still lacks specific examples to support the claim.)

### Quarter 3:
"Not even talking in the line of respect like EMS and defense forces deserve (it can be a fuck ton for them in some cases)."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Still somewhat negative toward the concept of respect for elders, but it introduces a contrasting positive perspective on other groups.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Maintains control, referencing other respected professions as a comparison.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There's a casual intensity due to the language choice, but it doesn't veer into extreme emotional territory.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Provides a clearer comparison, making it more concrete than earlier sections.)

---

### Quarter 4:
"A few people I've brought up mention things like 'well they lived through x'. Again, simply living through a national or global event hardly seems worthy of respect."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (While the argument critiques the justification for respect, it also conveys some understanding of the elders' experiences.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker decisively refutes counterarguments.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The dismissal of counterarguments adds to the intensity of the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it mentions a counterargument directly, it lacks concrete examples of what “x” might be.)
