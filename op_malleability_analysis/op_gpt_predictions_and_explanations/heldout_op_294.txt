Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here's a score for each of the dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument's text. The scores range from 0.0 (very low) to 1.0 (very high).

### Quarter 1
**Text**: "CMV: People who enjoy horror movies are crazy and should be in asylums. I don't understand why people would enjoy watching anything with other humans they can relate to suffering and dying. I just don't get it."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The tone is negative and critical toward those who enjoy horror movies.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker expresses a strong opinion and feels superior in their perspective.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (There is a significant intensity in the use of terms like "crazy" and "asylums.")
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The argument discusses specific concepts, but remains somewhat abstract regarding the emotions involved.)

### Quarter 2
**Text**: "This goes for horror movies, /r/watchpeopledie, or just some TV show with abnormal violence like my beloved games of thrones or Walking Dead (never watched though). I can't stand watching a scene when someone is suffering for 'free', but so far in my life I felt like the only one feeling disturbed in those moments; so far, everyone I know has no problem watching."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (Continuing with a critical tone, with some personal reflection that suggests confusion and discomfort.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker conveys a sense of isolation in their feelings, but also asserts their viewpoint strongly.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The intensity is moderate as they express discomfort but also allude to personal habits and preferences.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The speaker references specific shows and communities, adding a degree of specificity to their argument.)

### Quarter 3
**Text**: "But I keep thinking I am the normal one and people should not enjoy (it sounds weird but I am not forbidding people to do anything. People should not enjoy drinking bleach. But if you want to drink a full bottle I have no problem with that)."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (The statement carries a negative connotation about enjoyment and suffering but tries to mitigate judgment.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker feels justified in their perspective but acknowledges the autonomy of others.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Thereâ€™s a blend of intensity with the analogy of "drinking bleach," but it's somewhat toned down with the acknowledgment of personal freedom.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The analogy is concrete, but the overall argument remains abstract regarding emotional connections.)

### Quarter 4
**Text**: "On the front page right now, there is a r/WTF link with 4k upvote (or score): 3972 Man Still Alive After being Cut in half by train [NSFL]. I think you would have to pay me something like 1k$ to have me click on this link. But 4k people clicking on it and recommending it to others, I don't understand. Whatever gore picture is behind this, is it fun? What is the motivation, the enjoyment?"

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The tone is negative, expressing disbelief and criticism of those who seek out such content.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker questions the majority's choices, asserting their own perspective as puzzling and contrasting with popular opinion.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There is a heightened emotional response as the speaker grapples with the idea of such suffering being enjoyed by others.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (This quarter is very concrete, referencing specific examples and experiences online.)

These scores reflect the emotional tone, sense of authority, emotional strength, and specificity of the argument across its different segments.
