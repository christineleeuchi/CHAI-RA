Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text, we can analyze them as follows:

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.6):** The argument has a slightly positive valence as it acknowledges the fun aspect of strip clubs while presenting a potentially negative outlook for them if brothels were legal.
- **Dominance (0.5):** The author presents their viewpoint with a balanced tone—assertive but not overly aggressive.
- **Intensity (0.4):** The intensity is moderate; the argument doesn’t evoke strong emotions but clearly states the author's perspective.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** The concepts discussed are somewhat abstract but are grounded in social norms and perceptions without specific examples.

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.4):** This section presents a more neutral but slightly negative perspective on strip clubs, hinting at a transformation in social acceptability for brothels.
- **Dominance (0.5):** Again, the tone remains assertive without being domineering.
- **Intensity (0.3):** The intensity decreases as it reflects more on social acceptance than personal sentiment.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** There are references to social contexts that provide a clearer image of what changes might occur.

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.3):** The argument becomes more critical of strip clubs, indicating a negative outcome for them, thus lowering the overall valence.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The tone becomes more assertive as the author articulates potential changes in clientele behavior.
- **Intensity (0.5):** Here, the intensity increases slightly with a more vivid depiction of client preferences.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** There is a bit more specificity, discussing what clients might prefer in a brothel setting versus a strip club.

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.2):** This portion has a markedly negative outlook on the potential loss of artistic talent in strip clubs if brothels are legalized.
- **Dominance (0.7):** The author expresses a strong opinion on the subject, showcasing firm beliefs about future outcomes.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The intensity here is higher due to an emotional weight regarding the fate of stripping as an art form.
- **Concreteness (0.8):** The arguments here are backed by clear cause-and-effect reasoning about how business dynamics might change, making it more concrete.
