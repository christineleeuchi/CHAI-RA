Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the provided argument, we will rate valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text. Here's a breakdown:

### Quarter 1:
**Text**: "CMV: A Quality Windows Laptop is Better Than a Macbook Pro I'm a high school senior going to college next year, and I've used Windows PCs my entire life. I built myself a gaming desktop about 2 years ago which I love. I love PCs for the whole slew of different choices and compatibility with some programs and games. I'm a PC gamer, so windows is the obvious choice. However, everyone in college seems to have a Macbook."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The sentiment is mainly positive towards Windows PCs and personal experiences, but there is a feeling of being outnumbered by Macbook users.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The author feels a sense of agency in their choice but acknowledges external pressure.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The feelings towards Windows and gaming are expressed with moderate enthusiasm.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The arguments and experiences are specific and personal, making them relatable and clear.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text**: "Here's the deal: My parents and my cousin in college want me to get a Macbook Pro 15 inch. It costs about $2550 with education discount. The specs: * 2.8GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 * Turbo Boost up to 3.7GHz * 16GB 1600MHz memory * 512GB PCIe-based flash storage1 * Intel Iris Pro Graphics * AMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2GB GDDR5 memory * Built-in battery (9 hours)2"

- **Valence**: 0.3 (This part is more neutral as it is focused on factual information, but there’s a hint of frustration with the price.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The author presents the information with some degree of control over the narrative.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The presentation of specs lacks emotional intensity; it’s more analytical.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Very concrete with detailed specifications given, making it easy to understand.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text**: "There are no solid benchmarks for this GPU as of date, but Apple says it's about 80% faster than the 750M, placing it somewhere slightly above or around the 765M range (correct me if I'm wrong) In comparison, an ASUS Zenbook UX501 has a 4K resolution screen, a slightly inferior processor, 96Wh Battery- versus 99.5Wh for Macbook, pretty good build quality, and a much much much much much better GPU, a 960M. This costs 1,500 on Newegg."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (Technical comparisons lean towards negativity regarding Macbook's value.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The author asserts a strong opinion in favor of the ASUS Zenbook over the Macbook.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The repeated insistence on the GPU differences conveys a strong sense of preference.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The argument is very concrete with direct comparisons and quantifiable data.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text**: "I want to like the Macbook, I really do, but I am completely baffled by the price vs specs. What makes the Macbook so expensive? I'll list some differences: The Zenbook UX 501 has: * better resolution screen (4k touch vs retina nontouch) * MUCH better GPU (R9 M370X vs GTX 960M) * numpad - personal preference, I like the full keyboard Macbook has: * Better battery life (6 hr vs 9 hr) * Better Trackpad (Force Touch vs whatever) * Build quality (but they are still both good) * OSX - I'm kind of neutral about this * ??? Is the Force touch trackpad, slightly better processor, and better battery life really worth a 1000$ premium??? And not even counting the far worse GPU..."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The author feels frustration and confusion about the price-to-spec ratio.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The author takes a strong stance questioning the value of the Macbook.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (There is a high level of emotional engagement and questioning throughout.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Very concrete with specific comparisons clearly laid out, strengthening the argument.)
