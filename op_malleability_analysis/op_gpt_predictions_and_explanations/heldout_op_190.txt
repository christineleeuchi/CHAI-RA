Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter, I’ll first break the argument into four segments and then provide a score for each aspect. 

**Quarter 1: "CMV: The tax on rich people is way too high and is therefore unfair. People always talk about how rich people (i.e. mega-millionaires and billionaires) are not paying their "fair share" in terms of income taxes."**

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The tone expresses a negative sentiment toward the current tax system for the rich.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker presents a viewpoint that challenges the prevailing narrative but does so with a degree of hesitance.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The argument is assertive but not overwhelmingly passionate in this segment.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (It introduces abstract concepts of fairness and tax contributions without specific examples.)

---

**Quarter 2: "They say how the tax rate for the rich should not be smaller than the tax rate for those who are not rich. But even if there is a great disparity in tax RATES, the AMOUNT of taxes that a mega-millionaire or billionaire has to pay is still greater than the average person's."**

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The speaker continues to express disagreement with the notion of fairness in tax rates.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The argument begins to assert itself more, challenging the conventional views more strongly.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The argument takes a more determined tone in refuting the opposing view.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (It starts to discuss tax amounts, making it slightly more concrete than the previous segment.)

**Quarter 3: "For example, an income tax rate of 10% on a person making 10 million dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 1 million dollars in taxes, but an income tax rate of 30% on a person making 100,000 dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 30,000 dollars."**

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Here, the argument clearly illustrates unfairness, which strengthens its emotional appeal.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The use of a concrete example enhances the speaker's position, emphasizing the perceived inequity.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The example showcases a stronger sentiment about the injustice of the tax system.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (This quarter is very concrete with numeric examples illustrating the argument clearly.)

**Quarter 4: "Even though the millionaire has a lower tax rate, it's not fair that he/she has to pay 1 million dollars in taxes while another person only has to pay 30,000 dollars. There shouldn't be a penalty in the form of tax for people who make a lot of money; it's simply not fair. It's also not democratic because while each person only gets one vote, the richer person gets a greater financial obligation to society than the average person."**

- **Valence**: 0.8 (The language indicates a strong discontent with the current system, enhancing the perceived unfairness.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The argument takes a more authoritative stance against the idea that the rich are not paying their fair share.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The concluding statements evoke a strong emotional response regarding fairness and democracy.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (While it states opinions about fairness and democracy, it’s less concrete compared to the previous segment.)

Overall, the argument presents a strong case regarding the perceived unfairness of tax rates for the wealthy, with increasing concrete examples and emotional intensity as it progresses.
