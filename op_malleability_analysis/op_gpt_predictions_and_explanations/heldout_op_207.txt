Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the specified criteria—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I will break the argument into four quarters and provide a rating for each.

### Quarter 1:
**Text Excerpt:** "CMV: Feminists should change their title (maybe to egalitarians) to disassociate themselves from the extremists. First, I know 'egalitarian' is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word 'feminism' has, but I feel like it's time for a change."

- **Valence (0.6):** The tone is somewhat positive, indicating a desire for change, but it also carries a hint of criticism toward the current state of feminism.
- **Dominance (0.5):** The speaker tries to assert an opinion but balances it with acknowledgment of the existing strengths of the term "feminism."
- **Intensity (0.5):** The argument is presented in a moderate manner. There's an expression of personal opinion but not extremely passionate.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** The argument is grounded in specific terms (feminism, egalitarian), making it relatively concrete.

### Quarter 2:
**Text Excerpt:** "The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or 'feminazis' if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy."

- **Valence (0.4):** The valence is negative due to the discussion of extremism and its association with feminism, contributing to a perception problem.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The speaker asserts a viewpoint regarding the impact of extremism on feminism, showing some level of dominance in the argument.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The intensity is moderate, as the speaker expresses personal feelings of being turned off by feminism.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The mention of specific phenomena (internet voices, extremism) provides a reasonably concrete basis.

### Quarter 3:
**Text Excerpt:** "My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting its support."

- **Valence (0.3):** This section carries a predominantly negative valence, indicating concern over the public perception of feminism.
- **Dominance (0.7):** The speaker expresses a strongly asserted opinion about the need for change due to the negative effects of extremism.
- **Intensity (0.7):** The intensity is relatively high here, as the speaker describes direct negative experiences related to the ridicule of feminism.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** While there are relatable personal anecdotes, the concreteness is somewhat lessened due to a more abstract discussion about public perception.

### Quarter 4:
**Text Excerpt:** "I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the 'feminazis' it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term 'feminism' would be the extremists."

- **Valence (0.5):** The tone seems more neutral here, as it explores potential solutions rather than focusing solely on problems.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The speaker retains some level of authority in suggesting a solution, though it's contingent on the actions of others.
- **Intensity (0.5):** The intensity is moderate, as the speaker provides a suggestion that reflects the overall concern without strong emotional engagement.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The proposal to change the term offers a concrete suggestion, but it's somewhat hypothetical.

### Summary of Ratings:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.6 | Dominance 0.5 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.7
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.4 | Dominance 0.6 | Intensity 0.6 | Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.3 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.7 | Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.5 | Dominance 0.6 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.6

These ratings reflect the nuances of the argument as it develops through each quarter.
