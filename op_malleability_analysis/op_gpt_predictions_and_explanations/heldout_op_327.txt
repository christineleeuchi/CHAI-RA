Here's the rating for each of the specified dimensions for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: Donald Trump Isn't That Bad I've been hearing about how bad Trump is for the past few weeks, mostly from more liberal folks online."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; it starts with a controversial statement)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Humble introduction; acknowledging various opinions)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Mild; more of a preamble to the main argument)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some specific context provided, but still general)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "Now I agree he's very arrogant, especially in the most recent Republican debate that he participated in. I can't say I like his style, necessarily, but I recently watched this speech of his: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXjz3qLufv8"

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed; acknowledges negative traits)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Acknowledges opinions but introduces personal reflection)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate; expressing personal opinions about Trump's traits)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Refers to a specific event that adds substance)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "Suddenly I can see why people like this guy and why he's leading the Republicans. He's a fresh face, and he doesn't act like a politician."

- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Assertive; making a strong statement about Trump's appeal)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "In that speech I linked to, a guy that stepped in for a minute said something along the lines of 'Trump is already rich, he's already powerful, he doesn't need to run for President. He's doing this because he wants to make America a better place.' Anyway, you can skin this cat a bunch of ways, but it seems that a lot of the reasons people had for not liking Trump really fall to the wayside when you actually listen to the guy talk."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Very positive; emphasizes altruistic motives for running)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Confident assertion about the motivations behind Trump's actions)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong; clear advocacy for understanding Trump)
