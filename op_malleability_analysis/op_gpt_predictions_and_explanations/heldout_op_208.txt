Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s a breakdown of the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the provided argument:

### 1. First Quarter (Introduction and Context)
- **Valence:** 0.7 (The tone is generally positive regarding the proposed tax change, though it acknowledges potential counterarguments.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The introduction asserts a viewpoint but does not aggressively dominate the discussion; it's more of a contextual setup.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The language is moderate, setting a serious tone but lacks fervency.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The references to authority lend some concreteness, but it’s largely introductory without specific data.)

### 2. Second Quarter (Impact on Labor)
- **Valence:** 0.8 (The argument presents a strong, positive view that lowering the tax will benefit labor, which is beneficial for individuals and the economy.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (This portion strongly advocates for the idea, presenting a clear stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument gains intensity with a direct assertion of the benefits of decreasing corporate taxes on wages.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Referenced study by the CBO adds some empirical backing, but the argument remains somewhat generalized.)

### 3. Third Quarter (Encouragement for Corporations)
- **Valence:** 0.8 (The argument is positive, as it emphasizes the potential benefits to the business environment, promoting growth and reducing tax evasion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (This section asserts a strong view about corporate behavior and economic implications, taking a clear stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (While the argument is robust, it lacks extreme language; the intensity is moderate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it is concrete in suggesting changes in corporate behavior, specific examples or data are not presented.)

### 4. Fourth Quarter (Economic Growth and Deficit Impact)
- **Valence:** 0.7 (The tone remains largely positive, suggesting that the changes could self-fund and stimulate growth.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It presents competing ideas, including potential budget fixes, but overall maintains a strong stance on the benefits of the tax changes.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity, presenting logical arguments without overstatement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This section provides more concrete reasoning about how tax revenues might shift, providing a clearer picture of potential outcomes.)
