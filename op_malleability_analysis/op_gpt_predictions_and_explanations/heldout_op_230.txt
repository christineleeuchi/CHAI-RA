Here are the ratings for the four aspects of the argument—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—broken down into quarters of the text:

### Quarter 1
**Valence:** 0.3  
The argument has a negative valence as it discusses the commercialization of education and the pressures placed on students.

**Dominance:** 0.6  
The argument conveys a strong sense of authority and criticism toward the current educational system and its relationship with the college industry.

**Intensity:** 0.7  
The intensity is high, especially in the claims about financial strain and manipulation of students, which elicits strong feelings of concern.

**Concreteness:** 0.5  
The argument is somewhat concrete, mentioning specialized high schools and the pressures students face, but could benefit from more specific examples.

### Quarter 2
**Valence:** 0.2  
The negative sentiment persists as it continues to explore the expensive nature of college education and the implications for average Americans.

**Dominance:** 0.5  
The tone remains assertive, but it broadens the focus to include general financial struggles, which dilutes the dominance a bit compared to earlier.

**Intensity:** 0.6  
There is still a high degree of intensity as the financial pressures on families are discussed, maintaining concern for the reader.

**Concreteness:** 0.6
