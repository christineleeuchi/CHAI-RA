Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument using the specified criteria (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) in quarterly segments, I will break the argument down into four parts and assign scores based on the 0.0 to 1.0 scale for each criterion:
  
### First Quarter:
*"CMV: Morality Exists This is piggybacking off of my previous thread, and I will attempt to clarify a few things here. Morality is important to our survival as a species."*

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive; asserts the importance of morality)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Assertive; presents a clear stance)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; introduces the topic without being overly forceful)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat abstract; introduces the concept without much detail)

### Second Quarter:
*"If we didn't have morality, then why would we, as human beings, ever look out for one another? Why would we care if someone else was hurt? At the end of the day, wouldn't we be only concerned about ourselves?"*

- **Valence:** 0.9 (Strongly positive; implies a moral obligation)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Confident rhetorical questions that challenge the audience)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High; evokes strong feelings about human nature)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific examples of looking out for others, though still abstract)

### Third Quarter:
*"Keep in mind that when I am talking about morality, I am talking about it as a person who hasn't studied philosophy. I am talking about it the way your average person would."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; no strong positive or negative charge)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less assertive; emphasizes a personal stance)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mild; presents the perspective as average, slightly lowering engagement)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete in terms of the approach to morality)

### Fourth Quarter:
*"However [another discussion on this sub] has made me start doubting morality even exists. I am having a hard time wrapping my head around this one way or another, and at this point (as another commenter has put it) I've broken through the Matrix into the Real World. So loyal readers of Change My View: break my spirit. Tell me why morality doesn't exist."*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative; reflects doubt and questioning)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate; invites discussion but shows uncertainty)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Medium; expresses personal struggle, though it invites engagement)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Balancing between abstract doubt and a concrete call to action)

### Summary of Scores by Quarter:
1. **First Quarter:** Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
2. **Second Quarter:** Valence 0.9, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.6
3. **Third Quarter:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.6
4. **Fourth Quarter:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
