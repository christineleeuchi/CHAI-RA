Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the given argument, I will provide scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter. Here are the scores based on the content and tone of the argument:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: I do not believe in a progressive tax system. Change my view."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Neutral; it expresses a negative stance on the progressive tax system.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker takes a firm stance but is open to discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The expression of disbelief is moderate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is clear but not detailed.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "I believe in a flat tax system, where everyone pays the same percentage of their earnings in income tax. I do not believe in a progressive tax system where richer people pay a higher percentage than poor people."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive toward flat tax, negative toward progressive system.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a strong preference for a flat tax system.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (More passionate about the belief in flat tax.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clearly explains the preference for flat tax.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "I am a working class democrat, but I do not see a progressive system stimulating economic growth. It seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed; expresses frustration with the current system.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The assertion is strong but couched in personal perspective.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong emotions about economic growth implications.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific claims about consequences of a progressive system but still abstract.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "On the other hand, I believe a flat tax based would be fairer. Rich people would pay more (because 15% of a million is higher than 15% of 35'000) but would still be encouraged to leave their capital in the US economy instead of finding ways around the tax code... Can someone make a solid case for a progressive tax system directed at a working class guy like me?"
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive about flat tax and its fairness.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asks for counterarguments, indicating openness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity in the desire for discourse.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Makes a clear argument regarding fairness and economic behavior.)

### Summary Scores:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.7
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.6
