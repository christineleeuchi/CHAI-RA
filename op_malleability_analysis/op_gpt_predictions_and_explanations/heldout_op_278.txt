Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s a score assessment for each requested dimension across the four quarters of the argument:

### Quarter 1: 
**Text:** "CMV: "Blackface" is not Racist First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people is racist."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The speaker acknowledges the racist history, indicating a mixed perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The tone is somewhat defensive; the speaker positions themselves against the majority view while recognizing historical context.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The speaker expresses a moderate level of intensity in their conviction and awareness of the topic.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The mention of historical context provides a concrete example, though it remains somewhat abstract overall.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "However, I don't think that has any bearing on blackface today. What if an actor of another race simply wanted to portray a black character, and so they darkened the color of their skin to make their appearance more accurate?"
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The speaker’s perspective leans towards a positive interpretation of modern blackface in specific contexts.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker takes a more assertive stance in this section, suggesting that the historical context should not dictate current interpretations.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There’s a stronger intensity as the speaker poses a hypothetical to champion their view.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The idea of an actor portraying a character is more abstract and hypothetical, lacking specific examples.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "There could be absolutely no mocking of race going on, and people will still shout 'racism!'"
- **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone is somewhat negative regarding the response from society, reflecting a sense of frustration.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts dominance in the conversation, challenging the societal reaction strongly.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (This part has a high intensity as it addresses the discrepancy in societal reactions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While the claim is more abstract, it speaks to a common experience in social discussions.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "For example, I know a white girl who tried to do an impression of Michelle Obama. She dressed up in blackface and made jokes about healthy eating and vegetables and whatnot. She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist. She only made fun of Michelle Obama's campaigning, and she never once made fun of her race at all. And yet, it was still considered racist."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (The speaker expresses ambivalence, acknowledging that the impression was in bad taste while defending it from a racial perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The anecdote carries less dominance; it illustrates a point but doesn’t assert power in the debate.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There’s significant intensity in the recounting of the social backlash faced by the girl.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The specific example provides a clear, tangible illustration of the speaker’s argument.)

Overall, these scores reflect the complexity and layered nature of the argument presented regarding the topic of blackface.
