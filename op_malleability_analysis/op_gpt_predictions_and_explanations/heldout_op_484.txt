Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument using the specified criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text, we can break it down as follows:

### Quarter 1
> "CMV: Politicians should be able to make 'Unbreakable Promises' in the election season Dutch politician [Mark Rutte](http://www.bnr.nl/incoming/678218-1312/rutte/ALTERNATES/i/rutte) promised voters that not one extra penny would go to Greece. Voters liked that and Rutte's party became the biggest party in parliament, and Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The tone is positive towards the idea of 'Unbreakable Promises' and presents Rutte's initial promise favorably.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The mention of Rutteâ€™s success presents him as a dominant figure, but there is some focus on the electorate's agency.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (It communicates moderate intensity regarding Rutte's promise and its impact.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument uses specific examples and situations, making it more tangible.)

### Quarter 2
> "Rutte broke his promise and kept sending billions of Euros to Greece."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This statement is negative as it highlights a betrayal, which carries a low valence.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It shows a sense of failure without strongly asserting dominance; it suggests accountability.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity is relatively high, as it discusses betrayal and its financial implications.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The specific mention of billions of Euros offers clear details, strengthening the argument.)

### Quarter 3
> "Lying politicians are a problem in many countries. I think there's an easy solution: let them make Unbreakable Promises."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The first sentence is negative about lying politicians, but the proposed solution is positive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (There is a call for change without strong authoritative claims.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, as it discusses a problem and presents a solution.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It presents a general notion of a problem and a potential solution, but is less concrete than previous quarters.)

### Quarter 4
> "An Unbreakable Promise would be some kind of legal contract that describes what a politician certainly will or will not do when he is elected. For that politician, the Unbreakable Promise would be like some kind of extra constitution. He cannot break it when he is elected. These Unbreakable Promise should be fully available online for all candidates. I think this is a great idea, and I'd love to know if there are any significant downsides to these kind of promises."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The description of 'Unbreakable Promises' is positive and seeks constructive dialogue.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (It outlines a suggestion rather than asserting authority, indicating a collaborative approach.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity; the proposed framework is serious and thought-provoking.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Detailed description of 'Unbreakable Promises' provides clarity and specificity about the concept.)
