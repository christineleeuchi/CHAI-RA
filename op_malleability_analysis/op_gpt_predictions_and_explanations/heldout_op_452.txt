Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here are the ratings for each of the specified categories for each quarter of the provided argument:

### 1st Quarter: "CMV: Public health should come before civil liberties when it comes to infection control. Quarantine has been used to manage the outbreaks of communicable disease since the 13th century."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (The argument presents a positive view of public health measures, though it may be seen negatively by those who prioritize civil liberties.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The argument asserts authority by framing public health as more important than individual rights.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (It conveys a strong stance but does not employ emotional language.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Mentions historical context and specific measures like quarantine, making it relatively concrete.)

### 2nd Quarter: "The purpose of quarantine is to separate from the general population those individuals who have been exposed to and are suspected of carrying a communicable disease but have yet to display symptoms."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (This part explains quarantineâ€™s purpose positively but can also create fear surrounding disease exposure.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (It reinforces the argument's main assertion about public health measures.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Descriptive but somewhat neutral in emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Clearly defines quarantine, making it a concrete explanation of the concept.)

### 3rd Quarter: "In contrast, isolation is applied to individuals known or suspected to be infected by contagious agents. Isolation separates infected from uninfected individuals during the period of communicability, and restricts their movement to limit exposure of unaffected individuals."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral explanation of isolation; it acknowledges necessary health measures without a strong positive or negative connotation.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Affirms the authoritative stance on managing infectious diseases but remains neutral.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (More factual than emotive, maintaining a clinical tone.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Very specific about definitions and processes, contributing to high concreteness.)

### 4th Quarter: "The quarantining and isolation of people often raises questions of civil rights, however a utilitarian view has to be adopted so as to preserve the health of the wider community; else, pandemics can ensue. Where an individual carries a highly contagious infectious agent, the welfare of the public should come before the individual rights of the individual."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (Presents conflict about civil rights, which could be viewed negatively by some, but argues for a positive public health outcome.)
- **Dominance**: 0.9 (Strongly asserts the necessity of prioritizing public health over individual liberties.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Uses the potential for pandemics to evoke a sense of urgency.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (While it presents a strong argument, it is less concrete due to the broader philosophical discussion about utilitarianism vs. rights.)

These ratings reflect the specific attributes of the argument in the context of how they may resonate with the intended audience.
