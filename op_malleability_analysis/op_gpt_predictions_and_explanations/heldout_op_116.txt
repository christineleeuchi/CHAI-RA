Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll assess each of these dimensions in four quarters of the text.

**1st Quarter Evaluation:**
- **Valence:** 0.3 – The initial tone is negative, expressing feelings of revulsion and disgust towards women's issues.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 – The author feels a strong sense of superiority in their experiences and beliefs, especially regarding women's rights discussions.
- **Intensity:** 0.8 – Strong emotional language is used (revulsion, disgust, anger) which elevates the intensity.
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 – The ideas presented are somewhat abstract, dealing with feelings rather than specific examples or data.

**2nd Quarter Evaluation:**
- **Valence:** 0.2 – The tone remains negative as personal beliefs clash with the author's upbringing, reinforcing a negative view on women's rights movements.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 – The author displays a sense of control over their knowledge and perceptions, though they acknowledge failure to address sexism.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 – The emotional weight continues with mentions of personal experiences and observations of gender discrimination, contributing to intensity.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 – This portion starts to provide more concrete examples of sexism in the workplace but still contains prevalent abstract ideas.

**3rd Quarter Evaluation:**
- **Valence:** 0.4 – Mixed feelings emerge as the author expresses guilt about their role in perpetuating sexism, signaling a slight shift.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 – There is a reduction in the authoritative tone as the author begins to acknowledge their complicity in the sexism they observe.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 – Emotional responses are evident (guilt and shame), but it is less intense than previous segments.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 – Specific situations and reactions to the resignation add a level of detail that enhances the concrete nature of the text.

**4th Quarter Evaluation:**
- **Valence:** 0.5 – A more balanced view emerges as the author expresses a desire to change, reflecting a neutral stance as opposed to purely negative feelings.
- **Dominance:** 0.4 – The tone becomes less dominant, as the author questions their beliefs and seeks input from others, indicating vulnerability.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 – While the desire for change is present, the emotional weight is more subdued compared to earlier sections.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 – The author reflects on their beliefs and acknowledges the limited empirical support for their views, making the argument more grounded.

**Summary of Scores:**
- 1st Quarter: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.4
- 2nd Quarter: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
- 3rd Quarter: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6
- 4th Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5

These scores reflect the emotional tone, assertiveness, strength of feeling, and the degree of specificity in the argument throughout its various segments.
