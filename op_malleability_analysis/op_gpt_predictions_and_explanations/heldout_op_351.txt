Sure! I'll provide a rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument's text. These ratings are subjective and based on the content and tone of each segment.

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence**: 0.4 (Neutral to slightly negative; the argument begins by discussing the unacceptability of making fun of people.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker is presenting their viewpoint but is equal to the reader in the discourse.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The tone is somewhat serious but not highly charged.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The argument presents clear social themes regarding humor and sensitivity.)

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence**: 0.3 (Negative; a critique of societal norms and double standards emerges.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker takes a more assertive stance against the normalization of making fun of fat individuals.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The intensity rises as they express their feelings about societal attitudes.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Somewhat abstract, discussing culture/behavior but lacking specific examples.)

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence**: 0.2 (More negative as the argument brings up misconceptions surrounding body positivity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker takes a clear position against derogatory humor aimed at fat individuals.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (This section is more emotionally charged, particularly in its appeal for compassion.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Introduces a specific group ("Healthy At Every Size morons") but not a lot of concrete examples.)

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence**: 0.1 (Very negative; strong disapproval of the act of making fun of people with mental health issues.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The speaker establishes themselves as a strong advocate against humor targeting vulnerable groups.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The tone is increasingly passionate and emotional.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The argument concludes with a clear statement of principles but still lacks specific instances.)

These ratings can provide insight into how the argument is structured and perceived in terms of emotional impact and argumentative strength.
