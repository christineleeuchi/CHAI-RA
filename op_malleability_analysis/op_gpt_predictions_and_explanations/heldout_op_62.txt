Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To analyze the argument text you've provided, I'll break it down into four quarters and provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter. Keep in mind that these ratings are somewhat subjective and may vary based on interpretation.

**Quarter 1: "CMV: I think the Olympic Games should be held in Greece every four years, with all the other IOC members contributing to the costs."**  
- Valence: 0.6 (Generally positive outlook toward hosting the Games in Greece)  
- Dominance: 0.5 (Moderately assertive opinion)  
- Intensity: 0.5 (Somewhat strong suggestion, but stated in a balanced manner)  
- Concreteness: 0.7 (Clear and straightforward suggestion)

**Quarter 2: "The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map."**  
- Valence: 0.2 (Negative view on the current state of Olympic hosting)  
- Dominance: 0.7 (Strongly stating a critical viewpoint)  
- Intensity: 0.8 (Strong language indicating high discontent)  
- Concreteness: 0.6 (Specific claims about financial ruin and wastefulness)

**Quarter 3: "Similar to the financial organization of the UN, all International Olympic Committee members should pay according to their ability. The Committee could invest in large stadiums that have an actual purpose after being used for the Olympic Games, namely, the next Olympic Games."**  
- Valence: 0.7 (Positive suggestion for a collaborative financial model)  
- Dominance: 0.6 (Assertive about the need for an organized financial approach)  
- Intensity: 0.5 (Moderate intensity in suggesting a shift in funding)  
- Concreteness: 0.7 (Specific proposal about funding and stadium usage)

**Quarter 4: "Furthermore, and this is just speculation, this would allow Greece to reap the benefits of the economic surplus generated by the Games."**  
- Valence: 0.6 (Cautiously optimistic about potential benefits)  
- Dominance: 0.4 (Less assertive due to the speculative language)  
- Intensity: 0.5 (Moderate suggestion of potential benefits)  
- Concreteness: 0.5 (Somewhat vague due to the speculative nature)

**Summary Ratings:**
- Quarter 1: Valence 0.6 | Dominance 0.5 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.7
- Quarter 2: Valence 0.2 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.8 | Concreteness 0.6
- Quarter 3: Valence 0.7 | Dominance 0.6 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.7
- Quarter 4: Valence 0.6 | Dominance 0.4 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.5

These ratings help capture the sentiment and strength of the argument presented in each quarter.
