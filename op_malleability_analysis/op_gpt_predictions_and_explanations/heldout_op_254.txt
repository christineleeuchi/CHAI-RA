Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the specified categories—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—for each quarter of the argument's text, I'll first break down the argument into four quarters and then analyze each quarter accordingly.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: [The Martian] Earth would not have expended the resources to try to bring Watney home. **Massive spoilers below.** I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking him dead."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, presents a premise)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Establishes a personal opinion)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low intensity, mainly introductory)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific reference to a well-known book)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Watney is not dead though, and has to survive on Mars via his wits alone til he can make some contact with Earth (his crewmates having taken all but one radio, and the one they didn't take having stabbed him before flying off."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (More positive regarding Watney's survival)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Continues to establish the scenario but still focused on storytelling)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate engagement with the situation)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Vividly describes Watney's predicament)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "A few plans are developed to save him, one involving a hastily built probe to resupply him which blows up on takeoff. That first one I buy. But the latter plans I don't. And I have two principal objections."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Critical tone towards the plans)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Beginning to assert more definitive opinions about the plot)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (A moderate increase in intensity due to focus on objections)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Discusses specific plans but not exhaustive on details)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "I just don't think the governments of two countries who don't get along great would coordinate to waste hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (the plan also scrubs Ares 4 by taking its ascent vehicle), all to have a very low chance of rescuing one guy at the substantial risk to 5 more people. And the Hermes mutiny to force the government's hand just seems absurdly implausible to me. Much more likely is that Watney would have been asked to compose letters to whomever he wanted, perform science til his food ran out (assuming he was willing) and then take a lethal dose of morphine."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative outlook towards the likelihood of a rescue)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Highly assertive in expressing objections)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong emotional engagement and critical analysis)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Very specific arguments regarding political and practical aspects)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.9

These scores capture the evolution of the argument through the quarters, from establishing the premise to expressing strong criticisms of the fictional scenario.
