Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument, I will assess it in four quarters based on the parameters of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**1st Quarter:**
*"CMV: I feel like the rest of the country looks down upon the United States South My city is really pretty normal for America. I don't know that many rednecks and everyone is pretty well educated."*

- **Valence (0.4)**: The sentiment indicates a negative perception of how others view the South but tries to counter it with a positive observation about the local population.
- **Dominance (0.3)**: The speaker expresses a personal feeling of being looked down upon, which may influence their perspective but does not assert control over the conversation.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The feeling of being judged is moderately strong, as it’s rooted in personal emotion and social observation.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: There are specific references made to stereotypes and the education level in the city, making it somewhat concrete.

**2nd Quarter:**
*"However I live in Alabama and our governor George Wallace literally stood in the schoolhouse door to prevent integration of the University of Alabama. Our current Chief Justice Roy Moore fought marriage equality so hard that my state's ban on same sex marriage had to be struck down *twice*."*

- **Valence (0.3)**: This section carries a negative historical context, suggesting a problematic history that affects current perceptions.
- **Dominance (0.4)**: The reference to political figures demonstrates some level of asserting knowledge but leans more towards expressing frustration rather than commanding the discussion.
- **Intensity (0.8)**: The intensity is high here due to the strong moral implications and emotions tied to civil rights issues and marriage equality.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: This segment is concrete, referencing specific historical events and figures, making the argument's basis clear.

**3rd Quarter:**
*"Though I am a left-wing progressive and used to being an outspoken critic of the right-wing establishment here, I consider the South my home. I love it here and I love the people (mostly). Like a family they get on my nerves, but I wouldn't have it any other way."*

- **Valence (0.5)**: The sentiment is mixed, expressing both affection and frustration, balancing positive and negative elements.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The personal claim of progressive identity shows some level of control but is countered by the acknowledgement of familial annoyance.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: There is a moderate intensity as the emotions intertwine, expressing complex feelings about home.
- **Concreteness (0.4)**: This section is less concrete, relying more on personal feelings than on specific facts or examples.

**4th Quarter:**
*"My accent is lighter so it's kinda hard to exactly place where I'm from and when I say I am from Alabama I get a typical 'oh that's nice' response and I assume they're just being polite. With the picture that the media paints of the South, I cannot help but feel that people stereotype me in advance."*

- **Valence (0.4)**: The sentiment here reflects a negative perception but again includes the complications of social interactions, leading to mixed feelings.
- **Dominance (0.3)**: The speaker does not assert much control, mainly expressing a reaction to others’ behavior.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: There is a moderate level of intensity in feeling misjudged based on accent and origin.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: This segment presents personal encounters with a moderate level of concreteness related to social judgments.

Overall, the argument represents a personal experience of pride in one’s home while grappling with negative stereotypes. The evaluations reflect this complexity in each quarter.
