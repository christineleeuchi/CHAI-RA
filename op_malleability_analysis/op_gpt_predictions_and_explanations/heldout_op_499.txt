Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the provided argument based on the requested dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), I'll assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the argument's text. 

1. **Valence** (the intrinsic attractiveness or averseness of the argument):
   - **Quarter 1** (First two sentences): 0.1 - The statements suggest a very harsh punishment, which most would find negative or aversive.
   - **Quarter 2** (Describing the protests and Molotov cocktails): 0.2 - While it's a serious topic, there's a negative connotation regarding the actions of protesters, raising the overall negativity.
   - **Quarter 3** (Rationale for police reaction): 0.3 - This part acknowledges the danger faced by police, but still centers on lethal consequences for protesters, maintaining a negative tone.
   - **Quarter 4** (Concluding thoughts on Molotov cocktails): 0.1 - This reinforces the aversive view of the actions being judged as immoral or extreme.

2. **Dominance** (the degree of control or authority expressed in the argument):
   - **Quarter 1**: 0.9 - The argument is assertive from the outset, suggesting a clear and uncompromising stance.
   - **Quarter 2**: 0.8 - Maintains a commanding narrative on how the actions of protesters are to be judged.
   - **Quarter 3**: 0.7 - Emphasizes the necessity and justification for police lethal force.
   - **Quarter 4**: 0.9 - Clearly articulates a definitive standpoint that endorses violent measures against protesters.

3. **Intensity** (the strength or power of the emotional response elicited by the argument):
   - **Quarter 1**: 0.8 - The statement is emotionally charged, calling for extreme responses to actions deemed violent.
   - **Quarter 2**: 0.7 - There is a strong sense of urgency and danger implied by the description of Molotov cocktails.
   - **Quarter 3**: 0.9 - The emotional appeal is very high in arguing for the justification of deadly force in a protest scenario.
   - **Quarter 4**: 0.8 - Reinforces a strong emotional stance against the act of throwing Molotov cocktails.

4. **Concreteness** (the extent to which the argument includes specific, tangible examples or details):
   - **Quarter 1**: 0.5 - The mention of Molotov cocktails offers some concrete imagery, but lacks detailed context.
   - **Quarter 2**: 0.6 - Provides specific references to the method of attack (Molotov cocktails) while lacking broader context.
   - **Quarter 3**: 0.4 - More abstract in justifying responses rather than providing concrete examples of police action.
   - **Quarter 4**: 0.5 - The conclusion reinforces points made but does not introduce additional concrete details.
