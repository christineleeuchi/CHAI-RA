Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s a breakdown of the argument based on the requested criteria, divided into four quarters as indicated:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: Since its inception, Christianity has resulted in more harm than good in the world. I'm not anti-Christianity."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The statement is largely negative due to asserting harm; however, the acknowledgment of not being anti-Christianity softens it.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The assertion tends to dominate the discussion by stating a strong opinion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; the language conveys strong feelings but is coupled with a sense of openness.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.3 (References to harm and good are abstract without specific examples provided in this portion.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "That said, I've come to the conclusion that at least as far as our physical world goes, Christianity has ultimately made the world worse."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (Very negative assertion about Christianity’s impact.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong domination of the viewpoint, presenting a definitive conclusion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Fairly intense in claiming that Christianity worsens the world.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The phrase "physically made the world worse" is somewhat concrete but still lacks detailed examples.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "Things that happened centuries ago (e.g. the Crusades) to the Westboro Baptist Church today seem to outweigh the charity and good that Christianity has brought to the world."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative overall but acknowledges charity and good moments.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Brings historical and contemporary context, asserting that negative examples outweigh positive ones.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Stronger intensity due to the emotional weight of examples involved.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Concrete examples provided, which help illustrate the argument, but still lacks quantitative data or specific statistics.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "I don't think this belief proves Christianity is wrong or inferior. After all, lots of people have done extraordinarily awful things in the name of something good. However, I do think that it should be acknowledged that in general, the death and despair done in the name of Christianity far outweighs the virtue done its name. That said, I'm not fully educated on the topic, and I'm willing to be proven wrong."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Balanced by recognizing that not all actions are inherently wrong or inferior; some negativity present.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Acknowledges that this view is subjective, somewhat reducing dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate intensity based on personal beliefs and ambiguity about the certainty of knowledge.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete here due to the use of terms like "death and despair," but it remains abstract due to lack of specific references or data.)

This analysis captures the varying levels of emotional and logical components in the argument presented.
