Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I'll break down the text into segments and assign scores accordingly:

1. **First Quarter:**
   - **Valence (0.4):** The argument discusses a sensitive topic that is generally perceived negatively, particularly around child protection. However, there are elements of advocating for bodily autonomy which adds a slight positive aspect.
   - **Dominance (0.6):** The speaker presents a strong standpoint of belief in bodily integrity, influencing the nature of the discourse, but there is also a recognition of societal norms.
   - **Intensity (0.5):** The argument presents a moderate level of intensity; while it raises an important issue, it is not overly aggressive in its language.
   - **Concreteness (0.5):** The ideas presented are somewhat abstract, revolving around legal and bodily integrity concepts, but they are grounded in recognizable arguments related to autonomy.

2. **Second Quarter:**
   - **Valence (0.3):** The negative implications of infringing on childrenâ€™s rights are clear, which adds to the overall negativity, despite an attempt to argue for bodily rights.
   - **Dominance (0.7):** The speaker emphasizes their perspective on the child's rights significantly, showing strong personal conviction.
   - **Intensity (0.6):** This segment has heightened intensity as it engages with societal norms and challenges them, indicating a firmer stance.
   - **Concreteness (0.4):** While the argument is linked to societal standards, it remains somewhat abstract concerning the nuances of consent and bodily integrity.

3. **Third Quarter:**
   - **Valence (0.5):** This part presents the complexity of consent legally and ethically, maintaining a neutral-to-negative valence due to the sensitive nature of the discussion.
   - **Dominance (0.5):** The argument remains strongly positioned; however, there is a balancing act between advocating for bodily autonomy and recognizing legal frameworks.
   - **Intensity (0.5):** This quarter's intensity is stable, presenting necessary considerations without escalating emotional language.
   - **Concreteness (0.6):** Here, the argument becomes more concrete as it discusses specific legal standards of consent, making the arguments more grounded.

4. **Fourth Quarter:**
   - **Valence (0.4):** The conclusion reflects both awareness and contemplation on a contentious issue, yielding a somewhat negative valence.
   - **Dominance (0.5):** The argument concludes by reinforcing the notion of bodily integrity but does not assert dominance as clearly as earlier.
   - **Intensity (0.4):** This quarter is less intense, as it leans more toward summarizing and clarifying the previous points rather than introducing new emphatic statements.
   - **Concreteness (0.5):** This segment provides a clearer definition, which adds some concrete elements but still retains some abstract qualities.

**Summary of Ratings:**
1. **First Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
2. **Second Quarter:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.4
3. **Third Quarter:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6
4. **Fourth Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.5
