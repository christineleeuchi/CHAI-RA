Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the given argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text, I'll provide a rating for each category on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

**1st Quarter:**
*Valence (0.6):* The sentiment is mixed; the author appears frustrated with the changing definitions but is open to discussion.  
*Dominance (0.5):* The author asserts their viewpoint but invites others to change their view, showing balanced power dynamics.  
*Intensity (0.7):* The author's language reflects a strong emotional engagement, particularly with the term "shockingly."  
*Concreteness (0.5):* The references to definitions and examples provide some concreteness, but the lack of real-world examples of "reverse racism" makes it less concrete.  

**2nd Quarter:**
*Valence (0.5):* The sentiment remains neutral, expressing confusion about terms without strong positive or negative emotion.  
*Dominance (0.6):* The author takes a more assertive stand by reinforcing their definitions and emphasizing the importance of community agreement.  
*Intensity (0.6):* There's a moderate intensity with the author's insistence on the shared meaning of words.  
*Concreteness (0.4):* The argument continues to rely on the concept of definition without substantial examples or statistics, which affects clarity.  

**3rd Quarter:**
*Valence (0.4):* The tone leans slightly negative as the author challenges the concept of "reverse" racism, displaying some frustration.  
*Dominance (0.7):* The author firmly argues their stance, suggesting strong dominance in their perspective.  
*Intensity (0.8):* The intensity increases as the argument becomes more explicit in defending the perspective against the backdrop of historical context.  
*Concreteness (0.6):* The reference to historical context helps solidify the argument but still lacks concrete examples of racism directed at white people.  

**4th Quarter:**
*Valence (0.5):* The tone is somewhat neutral; the author is reiterating their stance calmly but keen for clarification.  
*Dominance (0.6):* The author maintains an assertive tone, emphasizing their definitions but remains open to others' viewpoints.  
*Intensity (0.5):* The intensity is moderate as the author reiterates previous points without heightening emotion significantly.  
*Concreteness (0.7):* The clarification of "reverse racism" provides more grounding in terms of what is being defined, enhancing the concreteness of the argument.  

Overall, the ratings capture the argument's emotional tone, assertiveness, strength, and clarity across different sections.
