Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide rating scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I will analyze the text accordingly. Here are the ratings, presented for each quarter:

### First Quarter
**Text:** "CMV: Turning right on red from the 'outside lane' or 'left right turn lane' should be legal in most cases. As can be seen in [this image], in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from the inmost lane, but if there is more than one right-only turn lane, all others are prohibited from turning right on red."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is somewhat positive, advocating for a change in law.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument presents a claim without strong assertiveness; it appears to be an observation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The argument expresses a moderate desire for change but lacks passionate language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The reference to a specific image and mention of laws gives it a tangible foundation.)

### Second Quarter
**Text:** "I do not see why this is. If it is legal to turn right on red after checking for incoming traffic from your left in one lane, why would it not be in another? I don't think there is a significant likelihood of cars from more than one turn lane crashing into each other."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral questioning tone; not overly positive or negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (There is a clearer expression of opinion and challenge to the status quo.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate degree of engagement; poses rhetorical questions that indicate strong consideration.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is somewhat abstract but grounded in practical concerns regarding traffic.)

### Third Quarter
**Text:** "I also don't think it likely that a vehicle turning right on red from the leftmost right turn lane would be more likely to collide with oncoming traffic. Surely he would check both lanes of traffic before turning, just as the inside lane would check the rightmost incoming traffic lane as well as whether there is anyone that might be changing lanes into his lane before the intersection."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Maintains a neutral stance, focusing on logical reasoning without emotional language.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author provides logical reasoning and challenges perceptions, showing confidence in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Relatively strong engagement through reasoning, but still somewhat measured.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The reasoning includes practical scenarios, providing concrete examples of behavior while turning.)

### Fourth Quarter
**Text:** "However, I imagine that someone somewhere had a reason for making this a law, so I am quite willing to change my view if given reasoning as to why turning right on red from anything but the inside lane is predominantly illegal."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Opens up a willingness to receive new information, creating a more positive tone toward dialogue.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Low assertiveness as it expresses openness to other perspectives and relinquishes strong dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Mildly engaged; the willingness to change oneâ€™s view adds complexity but lacks strong passion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat abstract; acknowledges the existence of reasons but does not specify any concrete examples.)

In summary, the ratings reflect the varying tones and degrees of assertiveness and engagement throughout the argument.
