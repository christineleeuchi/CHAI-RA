Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument on the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, let's break it down into four quarters and provide scores for each:

### Quarter 1
"CMV: Common usage of "xe" or other gender neutral pronoun would improve/make English language easier."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Generally positive about the introduction of a new pronoun)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker holds a position of authority or expertise on the topic but is inviting discussion)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, presenting an opinion rather than a strong conviction)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat abstract, as it discusses language rather than a tangible subject)

### Quarter 2
"There must have been thousands of times when i was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and i chose the pronoun she or he, maybe i wrote he/she, and it just feels like using something like "xe" would be much more accurate and/or easier than using he/she."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive sentiment towards the proposed change)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less authoritative, focusing on personal experience)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (More expressive in describing frustration with existing pronouns)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Uses relatable examples that make the argument more tangible)

### Quarter 3
"Tell me why using xe or something like it in our every day language wouldn't be good."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Requesting counterarguments, indicating some openness to critique)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Equal footing; inviting others to share their views)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mildly intense; it's a searching question rather than a heated debate)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The request is abstract but also grounded in the idea of everyday language)

### Quarter 4
"I can see some people holding the view that this word has been dirtied by some people *cough tumblr *cough but i still believe that it wouldn't matter if a lot of people used it."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Mixed feelings; acknowledging criticism but maintaining a positive outlook)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced perspective but challenges existing views)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Expresses some degree of frustration with the criticism but also hopefulness)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (References a specific critique and a cultural phenomenon, making it somewhat grounded)

Overall, the argument presents a moderate to positive view on the adoption of gender-neutral pronouns, engaging with both personal experience and societal concerns while inviting further discussion.
