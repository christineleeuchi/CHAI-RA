Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break the argument into four quarters and evaluate each one accordingly.

1. **First Quarter: "CMV: Vegetarianism is senseless and is actually equal to being against humans First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetarians/vegans for ethical reasons."**
   - **Valence:** 0.1 (The tone is negative, presenting vegetarianism as unreasonable.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (The statement asserts a strong position against vegetarianism.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (The claim is strong and provocative, but lacks a detailed argument.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.4 (It is somewhat abstract, discussing broad ethical concepts.)

2. **Second Quarter: "Being a vegetarian is more expensive than eating meat. Therefore, you need to get this money from elsewhere."**
   - **Valence:** 0.2 (Still has a negative tone, focusing on cost implications of vegetarianism.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument makes a claim that vegetarianism has financial consequences, but it is more factual.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a moderate level of intensity in the financial argument being made.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This quarter has a more concrete claim about costs related to dietary choices.)

3. **Third Quarter: "This ultimately ends in a society having less money/resources, which they can give to the poor. Thus, you are kind of killing humans in trying to save animals."**
   - **Valence:** 0.2 (It retains a negative view and presents a strong accusation.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.8 (This segment contains a strong assertion about the consequences of vegetarianism.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (The claim that being vegetarian contributes to harming humans is quite intense.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Although it discusses societal issues, the link to vegetarianism is somewhat abstract.)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "Of course, this is not how society works, you are not directly killing people by being a vegetarian, but you are not directly helping animals either, so that is not an argument. I fail to see any argument against this."**
   - **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone is somewhat defeatist and critical, but less aggressive than earlier sections.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker positions themselves as confident, though there's some acknowledgment of complexity.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (The intensity is moderate as it recognizes limitations in the argument.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (This section acknowledges the complexity of the argument but remains somewhat abstract.)

Overall, the ratings reflect a largely negative and assertive stance against vegetarianism, with a mix of factual assertions and abstract ethical discussions.
