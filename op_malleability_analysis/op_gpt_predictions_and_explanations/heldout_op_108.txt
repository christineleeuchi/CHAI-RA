Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the requested dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument, we can analyze sections of the text as follows:

**Quarter 1:**
- *Text: "CMV: X is better than Y Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to 'why.'"*

1. **Valence:** 0.7 - The argument presents a favorable opinion toward X with positive terminology, though it includes a slight negative description of Y.
2. **Dominance:** 0.8 - The argument confidently asserts that X is better and uses assertive language.
3. **Intensity:** 0.6 - The argument's intensity is moderate; it expresses a strong preference but does not evoke extreme emotions.
4. **Concreteness:** 0.5 - The comparison of sounds is somewhat abstract, though it uses relatable concepts.

**Quarter 2:**
- *Text: "2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in 'ly' that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below."*

1. **Valence:** 0.7 - It maintains a positive bias toward X while portraying Y as common.
2. **Dominance:** 0.9 - This section is very assertive, presenting statistical claims as evidence for the argument.
3. **Intensity:** 0.5 - The intensity remains measured; the argument presents facts rather than emotional appeals.
4. **Concreteness:** 0.8 - The argument relies on specific statistics, making it quite concrete.

**Quarter 3:**
- *Text: "3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. 4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). 5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable."*

1. **Valence:** 0.6 - There’s a slight negative spin on Y, but it’s less pronounced than in previous sections.
2. **Dominance:** 0.8 - The argument is asserting claims confidently.
3. **Intensity:** 0.5 - Again, the intensity is mostly factual, leading to a moderate level of engagement.
4. **Concreteness:** 0.8 - Strong use of specific examples and references makes this section concrete.

**Quarter 4:**
- *Text: "6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. 7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. 8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even 'American History X.'"*

1. **Valence:** 0.8 - This portion has strong positive sentiments tied to X and significantly negative feelings toward Y.
2. **Dominance:** 0.9 - The argument is highly dominant, using powerful rhetorical techniques.
3. **Intensity:** 0.7 - There is a notable intensity in the language used, especially in the sex and appearance arguments.
4. **Concreteness:** 0.6 - While the examples are vivid, they're somewhat subjective and less factual than previous sections.

These scores are subjective and based on an analysis of the argument's content and tone. The scale ranges from 0.0 (completely absent) to 1.0 (fully present).
