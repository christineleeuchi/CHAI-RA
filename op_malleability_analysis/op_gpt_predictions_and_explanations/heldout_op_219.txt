Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide ratings for the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break it down by each of the four quarters:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: Westerners' over hostility to less extreme Islamism is uninformed and unpractical Hello."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to slightly negative. It suggests that the hostility is misguided but doesn't portray a strong emotional stance).
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Neutral. The statement is assertive but not overwhelmingly forceful).
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low intensity. The language is fairly moderate).
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Somewhat abstract. It introduces the idea but doesn't provide specific examples).

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "Whenever I see a post about Islamism or conflicts including an Islamist side I see several errors that I will try to summarize."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral. The statement is observational without a strong positive or negative tone).
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Neutral. The speaker is expressing a perspective without trying to dominate the conversation).
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate intensity. There is a sense of urgency in needing to address misunderstandings).
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Moderately concrete. It refers to specific errors that will be outlined, indicating a structured argument).

### Quarter 3
**Text:** Lists and comments on specific misunderstandings regarding Islamism.

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive. Points toward a more nuanced understanding which implies a constructive critique of misconceptions).
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderate to high. The author takes an authoritative stance by outlining errors in others' arguments).
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity. The argument is more detailed, prompting critical thought and engagement).
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (High. The specific points provide clear examples, making it a concrete argument).

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "The cons of Islamist rule is not weighted against the cons of Military nationalist rule which is often the alternative..."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to positive. It explores a comparative analysis, implying a need for balanced understanding).
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Neutral. It presents an observation without imposing a viewpoint strongly).
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate to high. Engaging with complex systems like governance raises the stakes of the discussion).
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Moderate. While it indicates a comparative analysis, it lacks detailed examples necessary for full concretization).

These ratings may vary based on individual interpretation but provide a structured assessment of the argument's qualities across its sections.
