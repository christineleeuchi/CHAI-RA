Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score for each of the four categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) of the argument presented, I will analyze each quarter of the text individually.

1. **First Quarter:**
   - **Valence:** 0.2 (The argument starts with a profoundly negative and controversial topic, suggesting moral implications that many would find distressing.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker takes a strong stance, asserting their viewpoint authoritatively, which gives an impression of dominance in the discussion.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.8 (The language used evokes strong emotions, particularly fear and sadness, regarding suffering.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (References to specific conditions are mentioned, providing some concrete examples, but the abstract nature of morality remains vague.)

2. **Second Quarter:**
   - **Valence:** 0.2 (The description of suffering continues, which would be unsettling and negative for many readers.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (The continued authoritative tone reinforces a dominant perspective on the situation.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.9 (The intensity escalates as it focuses on the implications of undue suffering, heightening emotional engagement.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The mention of parental devotion and the concept of "return on investment" introduces a relatable context but remains abstract.)

3. **Third Quarter:**
   - **Valence:** 0.2 (The argument maintains a negative valence due to its focus on death and suffering.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker continues to express dominance, though there's a slight shift as the emphasis turns to justifications that may provoke counterarguments.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.8 (Emotional appeals are strong here, particularly regarding the concept of “suffering” for both the child and parents.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument becomes more concrete with specific scenarios, such as euthanizing an infant with leukemia.)

4. **Fourth Quarter:**
   - **Valence:** 0.3 (While still largely negative, there's a slight shift toward the idea of mercy that some might view positively.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (This section invites dialogue (CMV), which lessens the dominant tone somewhat.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity remains strong, particularly with the language of “living Hell” and strong conclusions.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.8 (It provides a clear and specific conclusion, focusing on the idea of suffering versus euthanasia.)

Summary of ratings:
- **First Quarter:** Valence 0.2 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.8 | Concreteness 0.5
- **Second Quarter:** Valence 0.2 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.9 | Concreteness 0.6
- **Third Quarter:** Valence 0.2 | Dominance 0.6 | Intensity 0.8 | Concreteness 0.7
- **Fourth Quarter:** Valence 0.3 | Dominance 0.5 | Intensity 0.7 | Concreteness 0.8
