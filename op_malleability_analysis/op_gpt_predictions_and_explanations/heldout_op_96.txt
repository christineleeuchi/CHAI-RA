Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the following aspects for each quarter of the argument, I’ll provide scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: My enjoyment of Bill Cosby's comedy has not decreased at all. Bill Cosby almost certainly raped a number of women."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Mixed emotions; enjoyment of comedy is positive, while the context of rape is obviously negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author presents their perspective strongly, but acknowledges the severity of the allegations.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument has a moderate intensity, expressing enjoyment alongside serious claims.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Specific example of enjoyment and a concrete allegation, yet somewhat abstract in its implications.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "That's horrible. It's awful. It's inexcusable."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (Very negative; all statements express intense disapproval.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker is clearly condemning Cosby's actions, but this is more an emotional reaction than a strong argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity; the statements convey strong feelings of outrage.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.2 (Abstract feelings of horror and moral judgment, lacking specific context or examples.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "It also has nothing to do with whether Bill Cosby is funny or has intelligent things to say about family life (within the boundaries of his comedy)."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive valence towards Cosby’s comedic content, while separating it from his personal actions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts their viewpoint more confidently here.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate intensity, arguing a clear division between the art and the artist.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Clear argument about separating Cosby’s comedy from his actions, provides a specific standpoint.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "I grew up listening to his comedy, I loved it then, and I love it now just exactly as much as I ever did. I don't care what personal faults, foibles, or felonies the man has. CMV and tell me why the art someone creates is degraded because of the artist's unrelated transgressions."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Affirmative feelings toward Cosby’s comedy, highlighting a positive personal connection.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker confidently asserts their position and invites discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (A balanced intensity, mixing nostalgia with a challenge to the audience.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Strongly articulated personal experience and a clear argument framing the issue of art vs. the artist.)
