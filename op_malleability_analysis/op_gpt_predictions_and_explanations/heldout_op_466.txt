Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument provided in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of its text, we can break it down as follows:

### Quarter 1: "CMV: Students should not be evaluated through creative projects for certain subjects In English class for example, I often get group projects where we have to portray certain things in a 'creative way.'"

- **Valence**: 0.4 (The statement reflects a negative perspective regarding evaluations in creative projects, but is somewhat neutral in tone.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker expresses a clear opinion and seeks to challenge the current evaluation system.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The speaker feels strongly about the issue but hasn't yet provided deep emotional implications.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The argument begins to introduce specific examples but lacks detail at this point.)

### Quarter 2: "This usually involves creating a painting/drawing, or a video/mini movie. The problem is, I have pretty much no drawing ability or acting ability."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (The tone conveys frustration about personal limitations in creativity, leaning towards negative.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The expression of personal limitations shows an attempt to assert a viewpoint, but it's more about personal experience.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The speaker's frustration is clearer here, expressing a stronger emotional viewpoint.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The mention of specific forms of creative expression (painting/drawing, video) adds concreteness.)

### Quarter 3: "As much as teachers say that it doesn't matter if you're good at drawing/acting or not, in the end, it always does! An elaborate oil painting on something will always get higher marks than a sketch with stick figures."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The argument emphasizes unfairness and frustration, leaning negatively.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker argues firmly against the current grading practices, asserting the importance of artistic skill.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (This part has strong emotions tied to the perceived injustice in evaluation, conveying high intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Concrete examples (oil painting vs. stick figures) make the argument more tangible.)

### Quarter 4: "I understand that spending more time is justifiable for getting higher marks, but I don't think having good drawing/acting skills is for ENGLISH class. Why should I have to draw and act for English, shouldn't I be doing those in Art and Drama class?"

- **Valence**: 0.4 (The paragraph conveys disagreement and frustration but also recognizes a point about dedication.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The speaker asks rhetorical questions that assert their position clearly.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There is an underlying emotional response to having to engage in unrelated skills in English class.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Questions about the appropriateness of evaluation methods in different subjects provide some specificity.)

### Summary
- **Quarter 1**: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 2**: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 3**: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7
- **Quarter 4**: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.8, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6
