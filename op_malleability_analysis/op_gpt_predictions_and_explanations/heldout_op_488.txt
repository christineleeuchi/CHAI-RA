Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide rating scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness throughout the argument, I will analyze the text in four quarters, giving a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each category.

### Quarter 1: 
*"CMV: Approving the Iran deal is in the best interest of U.S. national security. I don't see a lot of discussion of the Iran deal on Reddit, which is surprising to me since I think there's a good chance it will wind up as the most significant foreign policy development of the Obama presidency."*

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The speaker has a positive view of the Iran deal being in U.S. national security interests, though there's a slightly critical note on the lack of discussion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion; they want to guide the conversation toward the importance of the Iran deal.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The speaker expresses a moderate level of enthusiasm for the subject, indicating its significance.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is relatively abstract at this point but introduces specific terms like "U.S. national security" and "foreign policy.")

### Quarter 2:
*"Before I launch into my discussion of this issue, let me state the assumptions I'm making about how we evaluate America's national security interests:..."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral tone, outlining assumptions without showing strong positive or negative bias. Just setting the stage.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is establishing authority by outlining their assumptions, but it's more about clarification.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity remains moderate as the speaker outlines their reasoning process.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clearly defines specific priorities, demonstrating a more concrete understanding of the issue.)

### Quarter 3:
*"So the military option is awful. But in my reading, Option D (do nothing) is almost as bad. If we do nothing, then there are no restrictions and no oversight on Iran's nuclear program from the West whatsoever..."*

- **Valence:** 0.9 (The speaker expresses a strong negative view towards options C and D.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker strongly argues against other options, solidifying their stance for option A.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (The language conveys urgency and severity regarding the consequences of military options and inaction.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This quarter presents more specifics about potential consequences and policy alternatives, making it concrete.)

### Quarter 4:
*"If George W. Bush had developed a more coherent Iran strategy beyond just “let’s have some sanctions and eventually they will capitulate to our every demand somehow,” we would probably be in a much better negotiating position..."*

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The speaker critiques past strategies, conveying a sense of regret and frustration.)
- **Dominance:** 0.9 (The speaker confidently asserts their perspective on U.S. foreign policy and its implications.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The speaker expresses a strong belief in the significance of a sound strategy.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Analyzes the relationships between U.S. actions and Iran's responses, showing moderately concrete arguments.)

### Summary Ratings
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.9, Dominance 0.8, Intensity 0.9, Concreteness 0.8
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.9, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7

These ratings capture the argumentative tone, strength, emotional charge, and specificity of the text related to the Iran deal and U.S. national security.
