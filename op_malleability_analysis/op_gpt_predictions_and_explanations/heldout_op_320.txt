Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Sure! Here's a breakdown of the argument by rating it on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text.

### First Quarter:
**Text:**
"CMV: There is no possible advantage to playing a first-person shooter at less than the maximum resolution available to you. To get this out of the way early: **This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk.** An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone is somewhat negative towards lower resolutions and the notion of a circlejerk, limiting its positive valence.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is asserting a strong stance against lower resolutions, indicating a higher degree of dominance in the debate.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; phrases like "no possible advantage" convey strong opinion, but lacks emotional fervor.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (While the argument is stated clearly, it lacks specific examples or evidence at this stage.)

### Second Quarter:
**Text:**
"I'm talking strictly about advantages **in professional, competitive, skill-based, PvP shooters** given by playing at a lower resolution, taller aspect ratio (4:3 vs 16:9), or narrower FOV (excepting personal tolerance for distortion). [The linked photo] gives context about the argument."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Still maintains a neutral tone but begins to focus on specific contexts)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The specification of professional settings increases the weight of the argument, asserting dominant perspective)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Presents a more earnest and focused inquiry into the matter)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The use of technical terms begins to add clarity, but still lacks empirical support.)

### Third Quarter:
**Text:**
"**Points of confusion:** With upscaling disabled, the pixels are the same size... limited peripheral vision is an obvious disadvantage that's very simply fixed with a widescreen 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The tone here is analytical and neutral, aiming to clarify confusion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strongly asserts claims supported by logical reasoning and evidence.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The argument is more passionately derived using technical reasoning.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This section presents specific points with clear explanations and technical details, improving clarity.)

### Fourth Quarter:
**Text:**
"**Warrants / Assumptions:** No hardware limitations... 'Because they're used to it' seems to be the most common answer, but I feel like that's nothing but lazy and backwards."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The critique of common reasoning introduces a more negative valence toward the opposing viewpoint.)
- **Dominance:** 0.9 (This is where the speaker firmly establishes a strong stance against the lesser resolution viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The intensity is high as it confronts counter-arguments head-on with strong language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While there are clear assumptions made, some are wide and could benefit from specific examples or empirical support.)

### Summary Ratings
- **First Quarter:** Valence 0.3 | Dominance 0.6 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.4
- **Second Quarter:** Valence 0.4 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.6 | Concreteness 0.5
- **Third Quarter:** Valence 0.5 | Dominance 0.8 | Intensity 0.7 | Concreteness 0.8
- **Fourth Quarter:** Valence 0.4 | Dominance 0.9 | Intensity 0.8 | Concreteness 0.6

This breakdown evaluates the argument progressively, reflecting the evolving complexity, clarity, and assertiveness as it unfolds.
