Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To assess the argument provided, I'll break it down into four quarters and evaluate each based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. 

**1st Quarter:** "CMV: No closely related sports are any more difficult than the other People often time have discussions on what sport is harder between baseball/softball, football/rugby and so on."
- **Valence:** 0.5 - Neutral statement, introducing a subjective claim without strong positive or negative connotation.
- **Dominance:** 0.3 - The speaker is presenting their opinion but hasn't established strong authority or dominance in the argument yet.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - The intensity is moderate, as it reflects a belief but doesn’t strongly evoke emotions.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The comparison of sports is a tangible concept but remains somewhat abstract in its implications.

**2nd Quarter:** "However isn't every advantage that may make the sport easier a disadvantage to the opposing team?"
- **Valence:** 0.6 - This introduces a thoughtful question that could have a positive reception.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The speaker attempts to assert a viewpoint that challenges common beliefs, showing some dominance in the argument.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The intensity is growing as the argument delves deeper into comparative analysis.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - This idea is a bit more conceptual, though it retains some level of clarity.

**3rd Quarter:** "Example:(When in comparison to softball) 'Baseball is much more difficult since the ball is smaller thus so much harder to hit.'"
- **Valence:** 0.4 - Neutral example but it may hint at negative perceptions of baseball.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The speaker uses an example to strengthen their position, which can be seen as asserting a stronger standpoint.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - There’s more emotional impact here as it addresses an inherent tension between perceptions of difficulty.
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 - The comparison of the ball sizes is a clear, concrete example that can be easily understood.

**4th Quarter:** "Though isn't that an advantage to the pitcher? The opposite goes for softball while the ball may be easier to hit since it is larger than a baseball, that makes it more difficult for the pitcher to succeed."
- **Valence:** 0.5 - Neutral; it expresses a fact-based analysis rather than an emotional statement.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - The argument effectively builds upon previous points and asserts a nuanced understanding of the dynamics involved.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 - The language implies a deeper analysis of the topic, increasing the intensity of the argument.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - The examples remain grounded and relatable, providing a strong basis to support the argument.

To summarize:
1st Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.3, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.6  
2nd Quarter: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5  
3rd Quarter: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.8  
4th Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.7
