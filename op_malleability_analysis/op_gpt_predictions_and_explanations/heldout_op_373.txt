Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Hereâ€™s an evaluation of the argument based on the requested criteria, divided into four quarters:

### Quarter 1: "CMV: it makes sense to have a standardized test used for undergraduate admissions based more on thought process than knowledge Tldr there should be a reasoning based undergraduate admissions test"
- **Valence**: 0.6 (The argument presents a mostly positive perspective on introducing a reasoning-based test, though there is acknowledgment of mixed opinions.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (It provides an opinion but doesn't assert authority or dominance over other viewpoints, acknowledging the existence of opposing arguments.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The statement expresses a moderate level of conviction, presenting the idea but not pushing strongly against opposing views.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (The concepts of thinking process vs. knowledge are abstract and lack specific examples or evidence in this quarter.)

### Quarter 2: "The SAT is getting a large redesign soon. Many have said its focus on reasoning versus knowledge had a negative effect on college admissions. Reasons like it favored those of higher income backgrounds and whatnot."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (The discussion introduces negative perceptions about the SAT's redesign, balancing criticism with an examination of issues.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (This quarter mentions voices against the SAT but doesn't assert a strong dominance over these sentiments.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (It reflects reasonable concern regarding the implications of the SAT's redesign, which feels more intense than the first quarter.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (This part brings in a specific topic, the SAT redesign, grounding the argument in current events and critiques.)

### Quarter 3: "However, I think it makes sense to have a reasoning test available to students. The ACT is an achievement test. It is available to assess knowledge. A student's grades in their classes also demonstrate what they have learned."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (This portion articulates a clear positive argument for the reasoning test, implying significant benefits for offering it.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (It asserts a position on reasoning vs. knowledge, reinforcing a preference for a new type of assessment.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There is a stronger conviction about the reasoning test being beneficial, providing clear distinctions between the ACT and grades.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (While it discusses specific tests, it remains somewhat abstract when discussing reasoning capabilities and potential outcomes.)

### Quarter 4: "And the only argument I hear against it, that it favors economically advantaged students, doesn't make sense. Economically advantaged students are going to benefit with any test."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (This quarter clearly favors the argument for the reasoning test and challenges a common counter-argument, which adds positivity to the overall stance.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (It directly confronts a major objection, suggesting the author feels confident in their reasoning.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The argument is strongly presented, emphasizing shortcomings in opposing views and advocating for its stance with passion.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The discussion of economic advantage has more tangible implications, yet it still retains an element of abstraction in its reasoning frameworks.)

These ratings reflect an analysis of how effectively each part of the argument conveys its intended emotional weight, authority, conviction, and clarity.
