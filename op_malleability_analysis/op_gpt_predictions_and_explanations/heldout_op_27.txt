- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts a position but is open to discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument conveys strong feelings of doubt and concern about anarchism.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Some abstract concepts are discussed without specific examples of how anarchism might work.)

### Quarter 2 (From "bad." to "happen.")
- **Valence:** 0.1 (This section expresses frustration and negativity towards anarchism and critiques of the current government.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (There is a strong conviction that anarchism will not work, which dominates this section.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity of concern about potential violence and crime is high.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.3 (Still quite abstract; it mentions crimes but does not provide specifics.)

### Quarter 3 (From "However" to "function.")
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone shifts slightly more positive, as the speaker expresses a desire to understand.)

- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The request for explanations indicates a need for concrete examples, making it slightly more specific.)

### Quarter 4 (The closing statement)
- **Valence:** 0.3 (The expression of gratitude gives a slightly positive note, but skepticism remains.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (This section is less about asserting a viewpoint and more about soliciting responses.)
