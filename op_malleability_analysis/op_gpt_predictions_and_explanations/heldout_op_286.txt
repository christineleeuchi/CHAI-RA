### Quarter 2
**Valence:** 0.7 - Continues with positive sentiment about being thin as a desirable trait.
**Dominance:** 0.7 - The speaker maintains a strong position, though the tone is slightly less assertive when addressing the concept of offense taken by thin women.

**Concreteness:** 0.4 - Still lacks empirical support or detailed examples regarding societal attitudes.

### Quarter 3
**Valence:** 0.6 - The sentiment remains moderately positive, but the mention of "thin shamed" introduces potential negative implications, reducing overall positivity.

**Concreteness:** 0.5 - Introduction of specific phrases further illustrates the argument but lacks broader context.

### Quarter 4
**Valence:** 0.5 - The balance shifts with the introduction of the term "jelly," which could be perceived negatively by some, potentially muddling the overall positive sentiment.
**Dominance:** 0.5 - The argument maintains a somewhat assertive tone, but the perspective on othersâ€™ jealousy makes it a bit less dominating as it implies insecurity.
**Intensity:** 0.6 - There's a playful yet pointed tone here, increasing the intensity slightly as the speaker speculates on others' motivations.
**Concreteness:** 0.6 - The conclusion provides a clearer perspective on the perceived motivations of speakers who "shame" thin women, contributing to the argument's clarity.
