Sure! Here's a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**1. Quarter 1 (First sentence to "magazines.")**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Confused and bothered suggests a negative feeling, but the tone is not extremely strong)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker expresses personal feelings but does not assert authority over the topic initially)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The emotional response is moderate)
- **Concreteness:** 0.3 (The argument is more abstract and personal at this stage)

**2. Quarter 2 (From "In my mind..." to "...medical expert is qualified to determine which patients really need them.")**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument starts to solidify into a concern for safety and expertise)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts their perspective more here, emphasizing the role of medical experts)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The argument grows stronger as it discusses the volatility of medications)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some concrete details about medication and the role of doctors, but still somewhat abstract)

**3. Quarter 3 (From "I can't imagine what good these ads do..." to "...if any.")**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Frustration about the ads indicates a stronger negative feeling)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker is now more authoritative in expressing the ineffectiveness of ads)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The emotional impact is heightened as the speaker questions the utility of these ads)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete reasons are given for the argument, but still has a level of abstraction)

**4. Quarter 4 (From "Prescription dug ads..." to "...prescriptions medications allowed?")**
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Strong negative sentiment towards ads is clear)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker takes a strong position, questioning the acceptance of prescription ads)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (Very high intensity, as it concludes with a rhetorical question that emphasizes concern)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (More specific implications of ads on doctor-patient relationships highlighted)

Overall, the argument becomes progressively more assertive and emotionally charged as it unfolds, moving from a position of confusion to a clear and passionate stance against prescription medication ads.
