Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness in each quarter of the text, we would first need to define the terms briefly:

1. **Valence**: The emotional tone of the text, ranging from positive to negative.
2. **Dominance**: The level of control and authority expressed in the text.
3. **Intensity**: The strength or forcefulness of the argument presented.
4. **Concreteness**: The degree to which the argument is specific and concrete as opposed to abstract.

Now, here’s how I would rate each quarter of the argument based on these criteria:

### 1st Quarter
**Text**: "CMV: Tougher gun laws would not have prevented yesterday's tragedy where Bryce Williams killed Alison Parker and Adam Ward..."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (There’s negative emotional weight due to the tragedy mentioned, but a respectful tone is present.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The statement asserts an opinion, showing some control over the narrative.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The emotional impact of the tragedy is somewhat intense, but it’s expressed lightly.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Mentions specific individuals and a tragic event, grounding the argument in reality.)

### 2nd Quarter
**Text**: "Firstly, my heart goes out to the victims and by no means am I making excuses or defending any actions..."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (This section expresses compassion, which is positive, but still addresses a tragic event.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker acknowledges personal feelings and background, showing humility.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Emotionally resonates due to the personal connection and word choice.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Relates to specific personal experiences, making it concrete.)

### 3rd Quarter
**Text**: "While watching the comments role through in yesterday's /r/news thread, several comments mentioned the desire for tougher gun laws..."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The tone is analytical and somewhat critical of gun law discussions.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Begins to assert a clear standpoint against tougher gun laws.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The argument builds with reasoning, but is somewhat restrained.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (References a specific online community and discussions, but remains somewhat general in the argument about gun laws.)

### 4th Quarter
**Text**: "I so badly want to believe that we can prevent incidents like yesterday's from happening through tougher gun legislation or any other way, but I cannot see how. Please change my view."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (A sense of frustration and desire for change, but with a somewhat hopeless tone.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker invites dialogue and shows vulnerability in questioning their perspective.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (This section has higher emotional stakes, expressing a wishful but defeated sentiment.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (While it expresses a desire for change, the argument remains hypothetical, lacking concrete solutions.)

### Summary Ratings:
1. **1st Quarter**: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.6
2. **2nd Quarter**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.7
3. **3rd Quarter**: Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.5
4. **4th Quarter**: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.4

These scores reflect the emotional depth, argumentative strength, and specificity of each quarter based on the tone and content of the text.
