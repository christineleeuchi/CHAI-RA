Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To score the argument segment you provided, I will analyze each quarter of the text based on the four criteria: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. 

**First Quarter:**
"CMV: I feel homophobia is a symptom of more deeply entrenched personal traits, and feel uncomfortable around ex-homophobes due to assuming these traits still exist."
- Valence: 0.3 (Mixed feelings; acknowledging a problem but expressing discomfort)
- Dominance: 0.4 (The argument presents a personal viewpoint but lacks authoritative backing)
- Intensity: 0.6 (Strong emotions of discomfort are expressed)
- Concreteness: 0.5 (Somewhat abstract; talks about personal traits without specific examples)

**Second Quarter:**
"As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know."
- Valence: 0.4 (Expresses valid concerns but also fear)
- Dominance: 0.5 (Personal perspective is more pronounced)
- Intensity: 0.7 (High intensity when discussing personal wariness)
- Concreteness: 0.6 (More concrete due to the discussion of personal experiences)

**Third Quarter:**
"Thus when I hear someone say 'I used to be homophobic until [insert "my son came out," or "my friend came out" or etc.]' I assume they still are willing to hate groups of people they haven't met, it's just now that they know a gay person 'gay people' no longer fall under that category."
- Valence: 0.2 (Negative feelings towards ex-homophobes are emphasized)
- Dominance: 0.6 (Stronger argument asserting viewpoint)
- Intensity: 0.8 (Very intense reaction and strong assumptions are presented)
- Concreteness: 0.7 (More concrete due to mentioning specific situations and reasoning)

**Fourth Quarter:**
"While I am outwardly supportive when I run into these folks, inwardly I am uncomfortable to the point of being repulsed. Obviously it wouldn't be good to push for gay rights and then effectively punish homophobes for changing their minds towards being supportive, but it's hard to think in any way besides 'these people are still severely prejudiced or hateful, just not specifically towards me anymore, avoid avoid avoid!' Please CMV!"
- Valence: 0.1 (Highly negative view, especially towards the internal conflict expressed)
- Dominance: 0.5 (Balanced in expressing support yet discomfort)
- Intensity: 0.9 (Very high intensity as it captures strong feelings of repulsion and avoidance)
- Concreteness: 0.6 (Concrete in the sense of expressing personal experiences and internal conflict)

These scores reflect the emotional tone, authority, strength of opinion, and clarity of the argument presented within each respective quarter.
