Here’s a rating for each of the dimensions you mentioned—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—for the argument in each quarter of the text:

### Quarter 1: Introduction Statement
- **Valence**: 0.4 (Slightly negative; focuses on disqualification due to financial issues.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Moderate level of authority; the speaker expresses a personal view but leaves open the possibility that others can disagree.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Considerable intensity; emphasis on the danger of letting such individuals run the economy.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Somewhat abstract; while it touches on specific financial issues, it is more about the broader implications.)

### Quarter 2: Reference to Donald Trump
- **Valence**: 0.3 (Negative; criticism of Trump's self-reported wealth.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (High; the speaker asserts definitive claims about Trump’s financial integrity.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (High intensity; the use of phrases like "bullshit naming rights" adds urgency.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Concrete; provides specific numbers and comparisons to third-party estimates.)

### Quarter 3: Reference to Scott Walker
- **Valence**: 0.3 (Negative; highlights Walker's personal debt.)

### Quarter 4: Conclusion/CMV Call

- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Balanced; restates the main view while allowing for dialogue.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate; reflects urgency but not as strongly as previous sections.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (More abstract; focuses on the need for trust in leadership, which is a broad concept.)

These ratings aim to capture the nuances present in the argument across its different parts while reflecting the emotional and cognitive elements at play.
