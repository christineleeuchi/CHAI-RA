Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the provided text, I will assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of these dimensions.

### Quarter 1: Introduction and Context
**Text:**
"CMV: Charles and David Koch are more harmful to the United States than other super wealthy policy influencers. [A recent /r/news thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/34pnjw/billionaire_george_soros_may_finally_get_that/) focused on billionaire George Soros and the millions of dollars of taxes that he has avoided, despite advocating for higher taxes for the wealthy. Many commenters took advantage of this story to identify Soros as a liberal equivalent of the Koch Brothers, a view I am not convinced of."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The statement presents a negative view of the Kochs which is strong but also seeks to position Soros in contrast, offering a slightly balanced perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author positions the Kochs as central due to their influence, but gives some attention to Soros as a counterpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The argument clearly articulates the author's belief about the harm caused by the Kochs.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (There are references to discussions and opinions, but not much concrete evidence is presented yet.)

### Quarter 2: Distinction and Reactions
**Text:**
"I tried to distinguish Soros from the Koch brothers by pointing out that while both parties take advantage of current laws, the Kochs can be distinguished by their doggedness in perpetuating those very laws. [My comment wasn't well received](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/34pnjw/billionaire_george_soros_may_finally_get_that/cqx0ij6). Many of the responses that I and other Koch-detractors received accused us of being too selective about the billionaires that we criticized; that the Koch brothers were a distraction ('boogeymen') from a larger problem of rising oligarchy in the United States."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The author acknowledges criticism they receive, which softens the negative valence somewhat but still critiques the Kochs.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (This section features arguments from both sides but maintains focus on the Kochs.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a clear intent to defend the author's stance, which keeps the intensity moderate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The author discusses reactions but does not provide specific data or examples regarding the claims.)

### Quarter 3: Statement of Knowledge and Concerns
**Text:**
"Upon reflection, I realized that I don't know a lot about the Koch Brothers, apart from what I have heard on reddit and NPR, primarily, over the past few years. Here are some things I think I know:"

- **Valence:** 0.5 (This section is more neutral, as it expresses uncertainty about knowledge which lowers the negative connotation.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author begins to reflect on their understanding rather than asserting dominance over the issue.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The tone is less intense here as the author shows a willingness to reevaluate their knowledge.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The introduction of a list suggests a move towards more concrete points, although the knowledge is self-reported.)

### Quarter 4: Key Points on Koch Brothers and Conclusion
**Text:**
"* The Kochs promote climate change denial, which is useful when one is in the petroleum business * They astroturfed the Tea Party, which is nominally about freedom from the government and personal liberty (oversimplification?), but conveniently supports a very corporation/billionaire/petroleum industry friendly agenda * They have a poor environmental track record and support policies that will allow them to continue to harm the environment * They seek to maintain the low tax rate they enjoy personally, despite massive wealth inequality * They support low corporate tax rates, through the Tea Party and lobbying."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Strong negative claims are made against the Koch brothers, promoting a highly negative valence.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The claims made establish clear dominance in arguing against the Kochs.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The intensity is high due to the strong language and serious implications of the allegations.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (This section is factual, listing specific claims which are concrete and actionable.)
