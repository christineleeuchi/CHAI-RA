**Dominance: 0.7** - The author asserts their viewpoint confidently, indicating a belief that their reasoning is valid.  
**Intensity: 0.5** - The argument is moderately intense, with a more relaxed tone rather than high emotional stakes.  
**Concreteness: 0.7** - The author provides specific examples of their own experiences, making the argument tangible.

### 2nd Quarter 
**Valence: 0.5** - Neutral, presenting both the author's perspective and an acknowledgment of potential counterpoints.  
**Dominance: 0.6** - The author maintains a degree of control over the argument but also shows awareness that there are other views.  
**Intensity: 0.4** - This section reflects a lower intensity as it's more reflective than argumentative.  
**Concreteness: 0.6** - The mention of specific situations adds some concreteness, but it also contains more abstract reasoning.

### 3rd Quarter 
**Valence: 0.5** - Balanced sentiment, discussing societal conventions but also showing a hint of frustration at dryness.  
**Dominance: 0.6** - The author expresses their perspective on societal norms while positioning themselves as somewhat compliant.  
**Intensity: 0.5** - The intensity remains moderate as they balance their reasoning with personal feelings about hand-washing.  
**Concreteness: 0.5** - The argument becomes a bit less concrete, focusing on feelings rather than examples or specific practices.

### 4th Quarter 
**Valence: 0.4** - Slightly negative sentiment appears as the author expresses annoyance about dry hands and doubts about the seriousness of the topic.  
**Dominance: 0.4** - The author acknowledges the insignificance of the topic, suggesting less dominance in the argument.  
**Intensity: 0.6** - The intensity increases slightly due to a personal touch of frustration regarding hand dryness.  
**Concreteness: 0.5** - The argument again becomes more abstract as it centers on feelings rather than specific acts or evidence.
