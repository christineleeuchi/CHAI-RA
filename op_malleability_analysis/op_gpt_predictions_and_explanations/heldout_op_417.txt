Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here's a scoring breakdown for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1
**Valence:** 0.3  
*The argument expresses a negative stance towards the justification of the bombings, reflecting a low positive valence.*

**Dominance:** 0.6  
*The author asserts their perspective strongly, suggesting that others who disagree fail to understand justice, indicating a certain level of dominance in the argument.*

**Intensity:** 0.5  
*The argument has a moderate intensity; while it expresses strong feelings about the issues of justice, it's presented in a reasoned way rather than in an emotionally charged manner.*

**Concreteness:** 0.4  
*Terms like "justice" and "acceptable" are abstract concepts, lacking specific details or examples which would provide greater concreteness.*

### Quarter 2
**Valence:** 0.2  
*This quarter also maintains a negative valence as it challenges a common justification for the bombings, emphasizing skepticism and doubt.*

**Dominance:** 0.5  
*The author attempts to dominate the argument by disputing the "more people would have been killed" rationale, but it is slightly less assertive than the first part.*

**Intensity:** 0.5  
*The intensity remains moderate as the argument extends to complex reasoning but does not evoke strong emotional responses directly.*

**Concreteness:** 0.4  
*This section introduces hypothetical scenarios about Japan's potential surrender, which remain abstract.*

### Quarter 3
**Valence:** 0.3  
*Similar to the earlier sections, it maintains a negative stance regarding justification, so the valence remains low.*

**Dominance:** 0.7  
*This section is assertive in claiming that justification of the bombings trivializes death, making a strong moral stance.*

**Intensity:** 0.6  
*The moral implications discussed introduce a higher intensity, conveying a stronger emotional weight about the consequences of the bombings.*

**Concreteness:** 0.5  
*There is a slight increase in concreteness by referencing moral implications, though it still relies heavily on abstract concepts.*

### Overall Average Scores
- **Valence:** 0.27  
- **Dominance:** 0.53  
- **Intensity:** 0.53  
- **Concreteness:** 0.43
