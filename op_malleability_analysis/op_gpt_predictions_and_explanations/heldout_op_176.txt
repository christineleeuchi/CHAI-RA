Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the given argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break it down into four quarters and provide a rating for each category from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents the lowest and 1.0 the highest.

### 1st Quarter: "CMV: If pro-life views are ever to become law in the future, it must be done by covering the costs of birth and contraceptives first. I am pro life obviously. I offer a critique on the 'angle' of the traditional pro-life lobby."
- **Valence**: 0.7 - The tone is relatively positive and constructive, indicating a desire for reform within the pro-life movement.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 - The speaker positions themselves as knowledgeable and confident in their critique of traditional pro-life views.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - The language is matter-of-fact and assertive, but not overly emotional or aggressive.
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 - The argument introduces a specific suggestion (covering costs of birth and contraceptives), which adds some clarity.

### 2nd Quarter: "I believe the goal of centrist\populist pro-lifers, so EXCLUDING the extreme\radical holders, is to minimize abortions, not maximize children."
- **Valence**: 0.8 - This statement has a positive tone focused on reducing abortions, which may resonate well with the intended audience.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 - The speaker takes a stance and excludes extreme views, which indicates some authority.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - The statement is calm and measured, without excessive emotion.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - Clearly defines a target goal, making it a more tangible point in the argument.

### 3rd Quarter: "And thus contraception poses no ethical qualms with the above viewpoint. Abortion is often a more financially advantageous position compared to putting a child up for adoption."
- **Valence**: 0.6 - Provides an insightful perspective but touches on a sensitive issue, which may polarize listeners.
- **Dominance**: 0.5 - Presents an argument that challenges traditional pro-life stances, showing the speaker's willingness to engage with complex ethical issues.
- **Intensity**: 0.6 - Reasoned, but the implications can elicit strong feelings from different audiences, adding to the intensity.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - The discussion of financial aspects offers specific, concrete points rather than abstract ideas.

### 4th Quarter: "To nip in the bud a follow up to the above statement, I realize making it financially ADVANTAGEOUS (though way of say a credit for children born) would create a 'cobra market.' I also believe forcing women who have been raped or are in risky pregnancies to complete their births is wrong. So I believe for someone who is seriously pro-life, it should be seen as a step in the right direction to obtain that goal, by eliminating reasons why a person would or should choose to end a pregnancy."
- **Valence**: 0.7 - Addresses sensitive topics with compassion, particularly regarding women in difficult situations.
- **Dominance**: 0.5 - The speaker shows awareness of potential criticisms (the "cobra market"), but the stance may alienate some.
- **Intensity**: 0.7 - This portion carries more emotional weight due to the focus on women's rights and difficult circumstances.
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 - Offers specific ideas about potential policies and ethical considerations, making the argument very tangible.

**Summary of Ratings**:
1. 1st Quarter: Valence (0.7), Dominance (0.6), Intensity (0.5), Concreteness (0.6)
2. 2nd Quarter: Valence (0.8), Dominance (0.6), Intensity (0.5), Concreteness (0.7)
3. 3rd Quarter: Valence (0.6), Dominance (0.5), Intensity (0.6), Concreteness (0.7)
4. 4th Quarter: Valence (0.7), Dominance (0.5), Intensity (0.7), Concreteness (0.8)

These ratings reflect the different elements of persuasion and clarity within each section of the argument.
