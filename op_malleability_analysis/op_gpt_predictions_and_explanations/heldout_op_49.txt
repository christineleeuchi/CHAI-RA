Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the argument in each quarter of the text, here's the breakdown:

### 1st Quarter: "CMV: There is no 'wrong time' to break up with someone You often hear complaints that a person is a bastard/bitch for breaking up with his/her girlfriend/boyfriend just before/after X event (be it a graduation, Christmas, death in the family etc.)."

- **Valence**: 0.6 - The sentiment is somewhat negative due to the use of strong descriptors (bastard/bitch) but is overall neutral in expressing a perspective on relationships.
- **Dominance**: 0.7 - The argument takes a clear stance, suggesting a strong assertion of belief regarding breakups being timely or not.
- **Intensity**: 0.6 - The language used is moderately intense, especially with the strong labels for people who break up at sensitive times.
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 - Using specific events (graduation, Christmas, death) makes the argument very concrete.

### 2nd Quarter: "I think that this is entirely unreasonable. If one has made up his/her mind to break it off with a romantic partner, there is no need to delay the inevitable."

- **Valence**: 0.6 - Maintains a somewhat negative opinion on the perceptions of timing in breakups but leans towards a rational viewpoint.
- **Dominance**: 0.8 - The speaker expresses strong convictions and beliefs about the unreasonableness of delaying a breakup.
- **Intensity**: 0.7 - The phrase "entirely unreasonable" denotes a firm intensity in the argument.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - The idea is somewhat abstract but can be understood through relatable terms (e.g., "break off," "delay the inevitable").

### 3rd Quarter: "There will invariably be some reason why 'now is not the best time.' Further, it is dishonest to stay with a person for any length of time after deciding conclusively that 'this person is not right for me and never will be.'"

- **Valence**: 0.5 - The first sentence suggests the idea of excuses having less weight, while the latter is more critical and could be perceived as harsh.
- **Dominance**: 0.8 - Strongly asserts that staying in a relationship under these circumstances is dishonest.
- **Intensity**: 0.9 - The arguments here are quite intense, particularly with the use of "dishonest" and "never will be."
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 - While the concept is certainly defined, the abstract nature of “honesty” and “wrong person" decreases some concreteness.

### 4th Quarter: "Staying in the face of certain relationship termination just to get past X event is unfair to both individuals involved. Obviously this train of thought only applies to long-term committed relationships rather than casual or non-exclusive ones."

- **Valence**: 0.5 - This portion discusses the unfairness of the situation, reflecting some negative sentiment but also presenting it as a rational thought.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 - Suggests that there is a moral aspect to consider but doesn't assert dominance as strongly as prior sections.
- **Intensity**: 0.6 - While it acknowledges a moral obligation, the intensity is moderate–not as emotionally charged.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - Ends with a practical application regarding relationship types which gives the argument a clear frame.

This breakdown captures the essence and tone of each quarter while assessing the aspects of the argument.
