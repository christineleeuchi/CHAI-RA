Here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1 (Introduction of the argument)
- **Valence:** 0.3 (The overall tone expresses frustration with the system, but it's more self-reflective and less emotionally charged.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author asserts their perspective but acknowledges a lack of knowledge, which limits authoritative dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate intensity, as the author feels conflicted about voting, but does not express strong emotions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The author makes concrete claims about their knowledge gap but does not provide specifics.)

### Quarter 2 (Expanding on the need for understanding in voting)
- **Valence:** 0.5 (The tone balances personal admission with a somewhat critical stance on uninformed voting.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The author presents their argument confidently, suggesting a structure for evaluating voters, indicating a level of authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Increased intensity as the author delves into the importance of understanding candidates and policies.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete suggestions for a testing process, but still lacks specific examples of what the test would entail.)

### Quarter 3 (Arguments for qualified voting) 
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone suggests concern for the system, yet thereâ€™s a hint of skepticism about the voting process itself.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author takes a stronger stance on the need for qualifications, showing more assertiveness in their argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Heightened intensity as the author argues that restricting voting to informed individuals is beneficial.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concrete ideas regarding how voting outcomes could improve but still lacks details on implementation.)

### Quarter 4 (Clarification and conclusion)
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Balanced tone as they recognize the challenges in implementing their ideas, but maintain their perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Maintains a reflective stance that shows self-awareness, balancing authority and open-mindedness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, acknowledging the complexity of identifying qualified voters without abandoning their view.)
