Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument using the specified criteria—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I'll provide scores for each quarter of the argument's text.

### 1st Quarter: 
"CMV: If you are unable to make above 40k/year you are not very intelligent. My reasoning is that having under 40k sucks, it's manageable, but it is a struggle."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The argument presents a negative view of low income, implying struggle and dissatisfaction.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker expresses a strong opinion, asserting a direct correlation between income and intelligence.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The language conveys a significant level of frustration regarding low-income situations.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The mention of a specific income threshold gives some concrete detail, but the concept of intelligence remains abstract.)

### 2nd Quarter:
"I understand 'intelligence' is a very murky word and everyone thinks they are intelligent, but in the general 'competency of life' sense of the word, if you are unable to hold down a good enough job that money is an ever-present problem in your life, I question your intelligence."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (The recognition of the murkiness of intelligence adds nuance, but it still leans negative regarding those struggling financially.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker maintains a strong position, questioning intelligence based on financial success.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (There's a moderate level of intensity in the questioning and the framing of life competency.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Links between financial capability and life competency provide a bit more concreteness.)

### 3rd Quarter:
"Now would be a good time to exclude a few groups: - Those who have a low income now, but are pretty confident in their ability to hit that threshold in a few years (think grad student). - Very handy(?might not be the right word?) people..."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (The argument takes a more neutral stance with the exclusions, showing that the speaker is considering other perspectives.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker is moderating their stance, which reduces the dominance of the original claim.)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (The intensity decreases as the speaker acknowledges exceptions and nuances.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The examples of groups excluded provide more concrete details, clarifying the argument.)

### 4th Quarter:
"- Those who could easily make a decent salary, but consciously decided that their life would be better if they made a lot less money (I have a friend that chose to work for a non-profit after receiving an engineering offer) - EDIT: I don't think this counts as changing my view..."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Further acknowledgment of exceptions maintains a neutral tone.)
- **Dominance**: 0.3 (The argument weakens as more exceptions are introduced, lowering the dominance of the initial claim.)
- **Intensity**: 0.2 (As more qualifications are added, the intensity of the argument diminishes.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Examples of specific occupations and choices increase the concreteness of the argument.)

### Summary of Scores:
1st Quarter: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5  
2nd Quarter: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6  
3rd Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.3, Concreteness 0.6  
4th Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.3, Intensity 0.2, Concreteness 0.7
