Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To assess the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of these metrics within each quarter of the provided text.

**1st Quarter:**
*"CMV:Most of the new jobs being created after the recession are low wage "McJobs" So I graduated from college in December of 2012 and started on my job search shortly thereafter."*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative sentiment due to concern about low-wage jobs.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker feels powerless in the job market but is attempting to provide their perspective.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in expressing dissatisfaction with available job opportunities.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Generally concrete, mentioning a specific time frame and context, but lacks specific data or examples.)

- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker feels a strong sense of frustration regarding the job availability.)

**3rd Quarter:**
*"Further backing my anecdotal evidence was the fact that the city I was living in during my job search built a new shopping mall and a new Walmart.

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Some negativity towards perceived misleading information regarding job creation.)
