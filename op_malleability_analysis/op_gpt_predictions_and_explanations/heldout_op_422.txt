Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break down the argument into its primary sections and assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each aspect based on the content provided.

### 1. Valence (emotional tone)
- **Score: 0.2** 
  - The overall tone is critical and somewhat negative regarding Game of Thrones' cinematography. While it expresses disappointment, it doesn't evoke strong emotions like anger or sadness, resulting in a low valence score.

### 2. Dominance (assertiveness or authority of the argument)
- **Score: 0.7**
  - The argument is assertive, presenting a clear viewpoint that contrasts other high-quality productions. The author uses specific examples and comparisons to establish their authority on the topic, lending a higher score for dominance.

### 3. Intensity (strength of the feeling/emphasis)
- **Score: 0.5**
  - There are moments of passionate critique, particularly around shot composition and the missed opportunities in cinematography. However, it maintains a relatively consistent tone rather than escalating intensity throughout, leading to a moderate score.

### 4. Concreteness (clarity and specificity of the argument)
- **Score: 0.6**
  - The argument is fairly concrete with detailed observations about shot composition and scene structure, as well as comparisons to other shows, but it could benefit from more varied examples to illustrate points more clearly.

### Summary Scores for Each Quarter of the Argument:
1. **First Quarter (Introduction and general critique of cinematography)**
   - Valence: 0.2
   - Dominance: 0.7
   - Intensity: 0.5
   - Concreteness: 0.6

2. **Second Quarter (Specific examples of shot composition issues)**
   - Valence: 0.2
   - Dominance: 0.7
   - Intensity: 0.5
   - Concreteness: 0.7

3. **Third Quarter (Comparison to other works and general standards for TV)**
   - Valence: 0.3
   - Dominance: 0.8
   - Intensity: 0.5
   - Concreteness: 0.7

4. **Fourth Quarter (Closing argument and reiteration of the main point)**
   - Valence: 0.2
   - Dominance: 0.6
   - Intensity: 0.4
   - Concreteness: 0.6

These scores reflect the overall structure and tone of the argument while considering how effective it is in conveying the author's perspective.
