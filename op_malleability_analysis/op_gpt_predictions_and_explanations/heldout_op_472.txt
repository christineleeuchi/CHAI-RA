### 1st Quarter
**Valence:** 0.8 - The author expresses positive feelings about the effects of Vyvanse, presenting a favorable view of its use as a productivity enhancer.
  
**Dominance:** 0.6 - The author asserts their opinions confidently, sharing personal experiences that support their stance, which indicates a degree of dominance in the argument.
  
**Intensity:** 0.7 - The language used (e.g., "magic pill") conveys a strong enthusiasm for the medication's effects on their life.
  
**Concreteness:** 0.6 - While grounded in personal experience, the argument would benefit from more specific data or broader examples to improve its concreteness.

### 2nd Quarter
**Valence:** 0.7 - The focus here shifts to the disagreement regarding early prescriptions, still maintaining a generally positive view of the drugs for those who seek to self-improve.
  
**Dominance:** 0.5 - The author maintains their position, but this section introduces a slight shift of focus as they acknowledge and critique others' experiences, which dilutes the dominance.
  
**Intensity:** 0.6 - The stakes of the argument are implied, with a strong assertion that views on who should use the medication can be overblown.
  
**Concreteness:** 0.5 - Again, while it reflects opinion well, it lacks specific evidence beyond anecdotal references, making it feel somewhat less concrete.

**Intensity:** 0.8 - The conviction in articulating why people should have the opportunity to enhance themselves via stimulants intensifies the argument's impact.
