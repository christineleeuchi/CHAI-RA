Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it down as follows:

### 1st Quarter: 
"CMV: There is no moral justification for pirating movies, music, or other digital content. Before I begin a disclaimer: I pirate movies, TV shows, and music. I don't intend to insult those who do the same thing that I do."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The statement acknowledges piracy but positions it negatively by calling it morally unjustifiable.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong position against piracy, which suggests a level of dominance in the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The tone is moderate; it starts with a clear stance but includes a disclaimer.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Specific terms like "movies," "music," and "digital content" ground the argument, but the ethical claim is abstract.)

### 2nd Quarter:
"I do, however, believe that the actions of myself and others who do the same are immoral and done merely for the sake of avoiding spending money if one doesn't have to."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (The language is more strongly negative, labeling the action as "immoral.")
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker maintains a dominant position but also reflects on their own actions.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The use of "immoral" heightens the emotional intensity of the argument.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The argument remains somewhat abstract in its moral reasoning, focused more on the principle than observable behaviors.)

### 3rd Quarter:
"I think an important point to start on is one that I think is always missed in these arguments. High quality digital content such as movies and television shows are a luxury in just the same way that diamonds are."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (This segment is relatively neutral, setting up a framework rather than expressing strong feelings.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker aims to assert a point but doesn't come off as particularly dominant here; itâ€™s more of an introduction to the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (This part is informational and less emotionally charged.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (References to "movies," "television shows," and "diamonds" make it quite concrete.)

### 4th Quarter:
"Life goes on without them. I don't mean to say that I don't watch a lot of TV or listen to a lot of music but that doesn't make them a necessity it makes me spoiled with a luxury item. As with any luxury item, the cost for it is usually higher than other things. Those who claim to be 'showing the system what's wrong' or 'fighting a corrupt system' are acting no different from someone who breaks into a diamond store because they find diamonds to be nice but too expensive to bother paying for."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (This section provides a balanced view, shifting slightly more towards the negative as it critiques those who justify piracy.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The analogy regarding the diamond store provides a strong position against those justifying piracy.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The analogy evokes a stronger emotional response as it directly confronts arguments often used by pirates.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (There are several concrete examples that underscore the argument, making it very vivid).

Overall, the ratings reflect the varying emotional and conceptual weight of each quarter of the argument, highlighting how the speaker navigates their reasoning around the issue of piracy.
