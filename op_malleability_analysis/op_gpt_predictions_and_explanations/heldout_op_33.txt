### Quarter 1: "CMV: I hate seeing rich kids and rich Asian people at my college. I do not have lots of money."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (The sentiment is negative; the author expresses hate.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The author feels a sense of powerlessness in comparison to the perceived wealth of others.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The author uses strong language, indicating significant emotional response.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Some general statements about rich people, but not much specific detail.)

### Quarter 2: "I got my AA degree largely because the state I live in pays for high school students to go to community college. I don't have lots of money and likely won't get lots of money (or any money) for quite a while."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The sentiment is somewhat negative, reflecting a feeling of being financially constrained.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The author acknowledges their situation but shares a bit of control in their education path.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Emotionally charged but more reflective than explosive.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (More factual information; mentions the source of financial support for education.)

### Quarter 3: "It greatly angers me, as a middle-class American, to see rich kids at my college."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (A strong negative sentiment; the author expresses significant anger.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Demonstrates a sense of frustration but also acknowledges the author's social position.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High emotional intensity due to the expression of anger.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some specific references to wealth and social class, though still broad.)

### Quarter 4: "Asian students also upset me for another reason. [...] I just feel gypped since they get to have nice things now and I'm going to have to wait several years."
- **Valence:** 0.1 (This reflects an extremely negative perspective and frustration.)
- **Dominance:** 0.2 (The author feels disadvantaged and helpless in this context.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Significant emotional intensity; particularly in discussions of feeling "gypped.")
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Some specific examples but continues in a somewhat generalized tone.)
