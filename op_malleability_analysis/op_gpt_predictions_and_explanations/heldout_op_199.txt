To provide a rating for each of the specified categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the text, we analyze the content and tone throughout the argument. Here are the scores:

### First Quarter
**Valence:** 0.5  
**Dominance:** 0.6  
**Intensity:** 0.5  
**Concreteness:** 0.5  

### Second Quarter
**Valence:** 0.4  
**Dominance:** 0.6  
**Intensity:** 0.7  
**Concreteness:** 0.6  

### Third Quarter
**Valence:** 0.3  
**Dominance:** 0.6  
**Intensity:** 0.8  
**Concreteness:** 0.6  

### Fourth Quarter
**Valence:** 0.5  
**Dominance:** 0.5  
**Intensity:** 0.4  
**Concreteness:** 0.5  

### Summary of Ratings
The first quarter presents a balanced perspective while expressing concern, leading to moderate scores in all but valence, which is neutral. The second quarter details personal experiences, increasing intensity and decreasing valence. The third quarter discusses severe personal consequences, resulting in high intensity and lower valence. The fourth quarter serves as a clarifying statement, reflecting a return to moderation in valence and lower contrast in dominance.

These scores reflect the nuances within each part of the argument, focusing on how emotional weight, assertiveness, forcefulness, and clarity play a role in the overall narrative.
