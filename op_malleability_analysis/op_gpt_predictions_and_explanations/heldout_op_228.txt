Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score for each quarter of the text based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will first break down the argument into quarters:

**Quarter 1:**
"CMV: Natural is a meaningless word. The word ‘natural’ implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction?"

**Quarter 2:**
"Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless you’re under any religious persuasion, the word shouldn’t have any meaning. It seems outdated and non-applicable."

**Quarter 3:**
"For instance it’s meaningless to me when someone says ‘it’s only natural’. What isn’t natural?"

**Quarter 4:**
"Saying ‘this happens in nature’ is the same as saying ‘this happens’. Because everything happens in nature. And so on."

Now let's rate each quarter:

### Quarter 1
- **Valence (0.4)**: The tone is somewhat neutral, presenting a conceptual argument without much emotional weight.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The argument posits a claim but does not assert dominance; it invites discussion.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The intensity is moderate; it’s thought-provoking but relatively calm.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: The discussion is somewhat abstract but has clear definitions regarding the term "natural."

### Quarter 2
- **Valence (0.3)**: The tone remains neutral but leans towards critical, as it challenges the validity of the word "natural."
- **Dominance (0.7)**: Here, the argument takes a stronger stance, asserting that the concept is outdated.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The intensity increases as the argument emphasizes the word's irrelevance.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: Offers some concrete reasoning, though still abstract in nature.

### Quarter 3
- **Valence (0.5)**: The tone is neutral to slightly critical; questioning the phrase "it’s only natural" invites reflection.
- **Dominance (0.4)**: Less dominant; it poses a question rather than assert a claim.
- **Intensity (0.4)**: The intensity remains moderate, keeping a laid-back tone.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The example provided gives some concrete context but is still quite abstract.

### Quarter 4
- **Valence (0.2)**: The tone is critical, summarily concluding the argument, with a slight frustration towards the concept.
- **Dominance (0.8)**: This quarter makes the strongest assertion, equating natural occurrences to any occurrence.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The intensity is relatively high as it presents a strong statement on the concept of nature.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: More concrete here due to the clear comparison made about occurrences in nature.

### Summary of Ratings:
- **Quarter 1**: Valence (0.4), Dominance (0.5), Intensity (0.5), Concreteness (0.6)
- **Quarter 2**: Valence (0.3), Dominance (0.7), Intensity (0.6), Concreteness (0.5)
- **Quarter 3**: Valence (0.5), Dominance (0.4), Intensity (0.4), Concreteness (0.5)
- **Quarter 4**: Valence (0.2), Dominance (0.8), Intensity (0.7), Concreteness (0.6)
