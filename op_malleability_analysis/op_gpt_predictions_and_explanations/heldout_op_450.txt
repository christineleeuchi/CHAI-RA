Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To assess the argument you've provided, I'll use the four dimensions you specified: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. Each rating will be given on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 being the lowest and 1.0 being the highest.

### Quarter 1: "CMV: The default provision of water at restaurants is often wasteful and should be stopped. Throughout my lifetime in the southwestern US I have been provided with water at restaurants whether I requested it or not. It's brought out even before drink orders are requested."

- **Valence (0.6):** The statement expresses a negative sentiment towards the default provision of water, suggesting it is wasteful.
- **Dominance (0.5):** It presents a personal experience that many may relate to but does not assert authority over the issue.
- **Intensity (0.7):** The argument conveys a strong viewpoint about the wastefulness of providing water without request.
- **Concreteness (0.8):** This part is concrete, citing specific instances of water being served.

### Quarter 2: "As many probably know, my area of the country is in a prolonged drought that has led to water rationing, limits on car washing and lawn watering, etc. We're all advised to limit water usage and waste by turning the tap off while brushing our teeth."

- **Valence (0.7):** It has a negative connotation regarding wastefulness in the context of a drought, reinforcing the argument's stance.
- **Dominance (0.6):** This section invokes a widely recognized issue (drought), giving it some strength.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The urgency of the situation is conveyed, but it remains more informational.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** It cites specific conditions (drought and rationing) that make the argument more tangible.

### Quarter 3: "We are trying to limit water waste but seem to overlook the waste generated by every diner, whether they will drink it or not, being provided a glass of water, sometimes even an additional carafe on the table."

- **Valence (0.7):** This section continues to emphasize the negative aspects of waste.
- **Dominance (0.6):** It maintains an expectation of shared responsibility, which holds weight but doesnâ€™t claim authority.
- **Intensity (0.7):** It presents a strong critique of current practices regarding water waste.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** The mention of carafe and extra glasses provides a clear picture of the issue.

### Quarter 4: "I certainly think water should be provided for free, but I see no reason that it should be provided preemptively rather than upon request. This practice should be halted in order to reduce water waste."

- **Valence (0.8):** This is a strong assertion of the author's viewpoint, advocating for change in a clear manner.
- **Dominance (0.8):** The author takes a decisive stance, commanding attention to the proposed change.
- **Intensity (0.8):** The final call to action has a high intensity, clearly advocating for a shift in practices.
- **Concreteness (0.9):** This section is very concrete, presenting a clear alternative to existing practices.

### Summary Ratings
- **Quarter 1: Valence (0.6), Dominance (0.5), Intensity (0.7), Concreteness (0.8)**
- **Quarter 2: Valence (0.7), Dominance (0.6), Intensity (0.6), Concreteness (0.7)**
- **Quarter 3: Valence (0.7), Dominance (0.6), Intensity (0.7), Concreteness (0.7)**
- **Quarter 4: Valence (0.8), Dominance (0.8), Intensity (0.8), Concreteness (0.9)**
