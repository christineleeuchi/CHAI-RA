Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To analyze the argument based on the aspects of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it down into four quarters and give a rating for each category. 

### 1st Quarter:
"CMV: I think having sex in elementary school would accelerate a boy's maturity. (So should I have had more sex in grade school?)"
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Mixed; the proposition is controversial and may be negatively received.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The author expresses a personal viewpoint, but it’s uncertain how persuasive it is.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The statement is provocative, but the intensity is moderate because it's presented as a personal reflection.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The idea is specific but abstract as it lacks empirical evidence.)

### 2nd Quarter:
"My gut feeling suggests that having sex while an elementary schoolboy would have made me mature faster - whether behaviorally or in other useful ways. I thought even as a grade schooler, I seemed too immature so I wish I had more sex in order to mentally / psychologically / emotionally grow up faster."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (A personal reflection that has a somewhat positive spin but remains controversial.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author seems to express a subjective perspective without asserting authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The desire for maturation is intense, but it is still framed in terms of personal experience.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (It is specific to the author’s experiences, but remains abstract regarding broader implications.)

### 3rd Quarter:
"Wouldn't all the endorphins and other neurological pleasure chemicals cause my mind to progress faster than I would have otherwise? I'd like to think so..."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly positive; engaging in speculative reasoning.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The proposition is speculative and relies on unsupported assumptions.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in the speculation; engaging with the concept of brain chemistry.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Speculative but still somewhat grounded in biology, lacking concrete examples.)

### 4th Quarter:
"But if you think early sex doesn't mature a boy, well why, and what'll it do to him instead? And despite all that, would it 'still be worth it?'"
- **Valence:** 0.5 (More neutral; invites debate and acknowledges opposition.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author attempts to assert a challenge to opposing views.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Balances between challenging and exploring different viewpoints.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Raises specific questions that can lead to concrete discussion points.)

### Summary Ratings:
1. **1st Quarter:** Valence: 0.3 | Dominance: 0.5 | Intensity: 0.4 | Concreteness: 0.5
2. **2nd Quarter:** Valence: 0.4 | Dominance: 0.4 | Intensity: 0.5 | Concreteness: 0.5
3. **3rd Quarter:** Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.3 | Intensity: 0.6 | Concreteness: 0.4
4. **4th Quarter:** Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.6 | Intensity: 0.5 | Concreteness: 0.6 

These ratings reflect the complexity and sensitivity surrounding the argument presented.
