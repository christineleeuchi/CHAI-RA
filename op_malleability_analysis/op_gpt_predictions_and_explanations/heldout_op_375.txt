Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To score the argument on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will analyze the text based on a quarter breakdown.

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.6):** The argument starts with a positive assertion about Dr. Seuss, highlighting the importance of his lessons, which adds a mildly positive tone.
- **Dominance (0.5):** The tone suggests a desire to influence educational curricula, indicating a moderate level of authority on the subject being discussed.
- **Intensity (0.5):** The intensity is moderate; while there are strong opinions presented, it does not evoke extreme emotions.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** The mention of specific authors and their perceived shortcomings adds a level of specificity and clarity.

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.5):** The focus shifts to questioning conventional themes in classic literature, suggesting disappointment, which slightly lowers the positive sentiment.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The author asserts their perspective more strongly here, indicating that they feel qualified to critique the literature taught.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The frustration expressed through language like "dull" and "annoying" raises the emotional intensity.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** This section maintains clarity with specific references to the books and themes, but it becomes less tangible as abstract concepts are introduced.

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.4):** This part of the argument reflects dissatisfaction with the education system, leading to a more negative sentiment.
- **Dominance (0.7):** The author positions themselves as a critic of the existing system, displaying higher authority in their argument.
- **Intensity (0.7):** There is a palpable sense of indignation towards the education system and the literature being taught, enhancing intensity.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** While discussing the lack of practical lessons, it becomes more abstract, slightly lowering the score.

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.5):** The conclusion attempts to maintain a constructive outlook but still expresses frustration, resulting in a neutral to slightly negative sentiment.
- **Dominance (0.5):** The authorâ€™s position remains assertive, but the tone reveals grappling with some aspects of the argument, leading to a more subdued presence.
- **Intensity (0.5):** The author calls for change but does not strongly evoke emotion in this final section, resulting in moderate intensity.
- **Concreteness (0.4):** The focus on general ideas of importance (not being a jerk, caring for the planet) reduces specificity, lowering this score.
