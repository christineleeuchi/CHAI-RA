Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it down into four quarters and assess each quarter accordingly:

1. **First Quarter:** "CMV: I think it's ok that children of wealthy parents receive some benefit from their parents' work."
   - **Valence:** 0.7 (Generally positive sentiment)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (A statement of perspective, but not overly assertive)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity regarding the acceptance of benefits)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Concepts are abstract at this stage)

2. **Second Quarter:** "People often complain that students from wealthier backgrounds have a step up, but is that really so bad?"
   - **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral sentiment, raising a question)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate, questioning a common sentiment)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (Stronger questioning of a prevailing notion)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some concrete implications of inequity, but still abstract)

3. **Third Quarter:** "I think the provider of any family, of any socioeconomic background, would say their motivation for working is providing for their family and improving the lives of their children."
   - **Valence:** 0.8 (Very positive sentiment towards family and motivations)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (Assertive statement about motivations)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (Clear and strong belief expressed)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete, but still somewhat theoretical)

4. **Fourth Quarter:** "This complaint comes up most often for college stuff. I would ask: if a wealthy family is having a fancy dinner, should only the parents get servings? Of course not, so why can benefits be shared in these instances, but not in academic ones?"
   - **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive sentiment towards sharing and fairness)
   - **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong argumentative stance and rhetorical questioning)
   - **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity due to rhetorical questions)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Uses a concrete analogy to clarify the argument)

In summary:
1st Quarter: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
2nd Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
3rd Quarter: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6
4th Quarter: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.8, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7
