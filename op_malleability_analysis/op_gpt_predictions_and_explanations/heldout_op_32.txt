Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Let's break down the argument into four quarters and assess the valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each section. We'll rate each category on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 indicates a lack of the trait and 1.0 indicates a strong presence of the trait.

### Quarter 1:
*"CMV: The living conditions for animals that are raised for slaughter are irrelevant. This is assuming the end product (consumed meat) is unaffected/not harmful to the consumers. Also, I am leaving out the issues that arise from breeding/sourcing animals. I am only really talking about once the husbanders (right word?) have the animals."*

- **Valence**: 0.3 - The statement presents a neutral to slightly negative view on animal welfare.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 - The speaker presents a strong opinion asserting the irrelevance of living conditions for animals raised for slaughter.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - The claim is stated firmly but not enthusiastically; it reads as a rational argument rather than an emotional appeal.
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 - Some abstract concepts (irrelevance) but clear in specifying the focus on husbandry.

### Quarter 2:
*"For any food source (plant or animal) I think the goals should be: 1. Increase in quality/nutrition 2. Increase in availability 3. Decrease in price 4. Decrease in time to harvest 5. Does not affect the well-being of the people involved in raising the animal."*

- **Valence**: 0.5 - The goals described are generally neutral or positive, focusing on efficiency and well-being of farmers.
- **Dominance**: 0.4 - The goals are stated as a preference but lack an assertive tone about their importance.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - The list format gives a structured feel, but the intensity of the argument isnâ€™t particularly high.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - The goals are specific and actionable, presenting clear ideas.

### Quarter 3:
*"So long as it is legal, I think farmers/animal husbanders should strive to meet those four criteria in whatever ways they can."*

- **Valence**: 0.6 - The stance is generally positive, supporting farmers' rights to optimize their practices.
- **Dominance**: 0.5 - The speaker expresses a clear expectation but does not convey a commanding tone.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - The expression reflects a typical opinion rather than a passionately delivered argument.
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 - The language is direct and practical, focusing on achievable actions.

### Quarter 4:
*"Change my view. Edit: I need to step away from Reddit for a bit (I am at work). Thank you so much for the responses thus far, I will do my best to continue replying in a few hours."*

- **Valence**: 0.4 - The invitation to change the view displays openness but is accompanied by an admission of limited engagement.
- **Dominance**: 0.3 - Suggests a willingness to be influenced but lacks assertiveness in the exploration of the topic.
- **Intensity**: 0.2 - The tone is much more subdued, reflecting a casual approach to the discussion rather than a provocative stance.
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 - The statement is straightforward, but the context of engagement diminishes the urgency or depth.
