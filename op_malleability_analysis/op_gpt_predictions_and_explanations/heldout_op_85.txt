Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To assess the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here are the ratings for each quarter of the text:

### 1st Quarter:
- **Valence (0.6)**: The writer expresses a positive affinity for theater but quickly shifts to a more critical perspective. The love for theater softens the overall negativity directed towards it, hence a moderately positive score. 
- **Dominance (0.7)**: The author clearly positions themselves as knowledgeable (an English teacher and a master's degree holder), which lends authority to their argument and conveys a sense of dominance in the conversation about cinematic superiority.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The intensity is moderate at this point; while the author is passionate about their views, they present the initial context in a balanced manner, leading to a less intense emotional response.
- **Concreteness (0.4)**: The arguments presented are conceptual and abstract at this stage, lacking concrete examples until the reasoning part begins.

### 2nd Quarter:
- **Valence (0.5)**: This section contains a mix of critical and appreciative sentiments, discussing the strengths of theater before pivoting to critique, leading to a neutral evaluation overall.
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The author continues to express their perspective with confidence. However, the inclusion of a counterpoint (the aspects where theater does better) indicates a slight diminishment in authoritative dominance in favor of a more nuanced discussion.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The intensity increases as the author passionately argues for suspension of disbelief as a key element of storytelling, conveying a stronger emotional investment in the argument.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The writer begins to introduce the idea of artistic intent and audience experience, making the argument slightly more concrete though it’s still largely abstract.

### 3rd Quarter:
- **Valence (0.4)**: The sentiment turns more critical towards theater's limitations, suggesting dissatisfaction with the medium, which lowers the positive valence.
- **Dominance (0.8)**: The author confidently asserts that film surpasses theater in establishing verisimilitude, displaying strong dominance and conviction in this part of the argument.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The intensity rises as the writer contrasts film's capabilities with theater’s limitations, effectively conveying a passionate defense of cinema.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: The explanation of specific examples (like the blood representation) adds a level of concreteness, making the argument clearer and more relatable.

### 4th Quarter:
- **Valence (0.5)**: The conclusion attempts to summarize and endorse the overall message, but the mixture of perspectives leads to a balanced but less positive score.
- **Dominance (0.9)**: The assertion that film is superior reflects a strong dominance. The authoritative tone in the conclusion exhibits confidence in their stance.
- **Intensity (0.8)**: The concluding argument presents a powerful summary of beliefs, energizing the overall intensity and making a clear statement about the superiority of film.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: The final points outline a structured argument, leading to a higher rate of conclusive examples of how film could have surpassed theater if both had the same historical context.
