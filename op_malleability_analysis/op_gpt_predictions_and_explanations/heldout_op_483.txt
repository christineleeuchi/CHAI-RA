Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, weâ€™ll analyze these aspects individually for each quarter. 

1. **First Quarter**:
   - **Valence**: 0.2 (Negative tone, criticizing the glorification of the military)
   - **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker asserts a viewpoint challenging mainstream perceptions)
   - **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity in expressing dissatisfaction)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.5 (General assertions with some specific historical references)

2. **Second Quarter**:
   - **Valence**: 0.1 (Highly negative, questioning the purpose of recent military actions)
   - **Dominance**: 0.5 (More assertive stance on the military actions being questionable)
   - **Intensity**: 0.6 (Higher intensity as the argument focuses on specific military operations)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.6 (More specific regarding the ineffectiveness of military patrols)

3. **Third Quarter**:
   - **Valence**: 0.2 (Continues the negative assessment, critiquing soldiers and the military as a career choice)
   - **Dominance**: 0.4 (Challenging societal norms about military service)
   - **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity in asserting the military attracts less qualified individuals)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Some specific points, but mainly generalizations about soldiers)

4. **Fourth Quarter**:
   - **Valence**: 0.3 (Mixed feelings; acknowledges some aspects of military service while still critical)
   - **Dominance**: 0.6 (Strongly asserts the need for a change in public perception)
   - **Intensity**: 0.7 (Higher intensity as it discusses the consequences of military actions and public perception)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Some specificity in discussing the concept of empathy towards soldiers)

So, the summarized scores for each quarter are:

1. **First Quarter**: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
2. **Second Quarter**: Valence 0.1, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6
3. **Third Quarter**: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
4. **Fourth Quarter**: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
