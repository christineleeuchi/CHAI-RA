Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the requested criteria—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I'll provide ratings on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the text.

### 1st Quarter (Introduction & Main Argument):
- **Valence (0.3)**: The argument is morally charged with a negative connotation due to the subject matter (ISIS execution videos), but it suggests a positive outcome (increased awareness and action).
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The argument displays a level of authority, as the speaker asserts a moral obligation and shares personal feelings about the issue.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The intensity is high due to the distressing nature of the content discussed (execution videos) and the emotional impact it has on the speaker.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The argument is somewhat abstract in its moral obligation but concrete in the specifics of the subject matter (ISIS executions) and personal experience.

### 2nd Quarter (Impact of Visual Exposure):
- **Valence (0.4)**: This part maintains a negative valence because it discusses horrific events but aims to argue that exposure leads to positive moral action.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The argument retains authority, with the speaker reiterating their belief in the necessity of visual exposure to evoke moral action.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The intensity remains significant, reflecting on the shocking nature of the content and its potential emotional impact on viewers.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: While the argument emphasizes the necessity to visualize the horror, it remains somewhat abstract in discussing the general audience's ability to imagine these events.

### 3rd Quarter (Clarification of Intent):
- **Valence (0.5)**: The tone here is neutral-to-positive, as the speaker clarifies that the intent is not entertainment, which softens the overall negative implications.
- **Dominance (0.4)**: The dominance is lower in this section as the speaker is clarifying their intent rather than asserting a strong position.
- **Intensity (0.4)**: Intensity is medium as it serves as a clarification rather than a reaction to the horrific events.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: This part is more concrete in the sense of pointing out the intended purpose and evoking clarity regarding the viewing of such content.

### 4th Quarter (Acknowledgment of Different Effects):
- **Valence (0.5)**: The valence is neutral because the acknowledgment of varying effects on different people indicates an open-mindedness that balances the argument.
- **Dominance (0.4)**: The authority is slightly diminished as the speaker recognizes the complexity of the issue and variability in human reactions.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: Intensity is moderate as it acknowledges a broader spectrum of feelings that viewing the videos might evoke.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: This part is more concrete as it discusses the diverse effects of the videos on individuals rather than generalizing about experiences.

### Summary of Ratings:
- **1st Quarter**: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
- **2nd Quarter**: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
- **3rd Quarter**: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.6
- **4th Quarter**: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7

These ratings highlight the moral weight and emotional intensity of the argument, as well as its strengths and limitations in terms of clarity and authority.
