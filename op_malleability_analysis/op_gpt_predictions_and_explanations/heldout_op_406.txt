Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s a rating for each of the constructs (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument’s text:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: I (white guy) do not benefit from racism I was born white in the USA, a country with a history of terrible racism and a justice system which is unfair to minorities. I continuously see articles like [I, racist] in which all white people are complicit in racism because they benefit from it, but that is where the argument stops. I have never seen a good defense of this argument."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The argument presents a negative view of racism but is defensive about not benefiting from it.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker positions themselves assertively against the notion that all white people are complicit.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The language conveys a certain frustration, especially with the lack of good defenses presented.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument presents specific grievances and references but lacks detailed examples.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Slavery was terrible for black people but it wasn’t great for white people either. Sure, a few plantation owners got away without hiring employees, but is that good for the economy?"

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The statement includes a recognition of the suffering of both black people and a nuanced view about the economic implications.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The argument is presented more as a counterpoint than a dominant assertion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There's a mild intensity in presenting an alternative viewpoint.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This section includes historical context and concrete examples but remains somewhat general.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "In the Civil War, millions of people died. Segregation was terrible and it ripped society apart. People complaining about how Obama doesn’t look American miss the opportunity to talk about policy."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The argument acknowledges historical tragedies while critiquing a modern perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It presents a balanced perspective but calls out a particular behavior.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The point about segregation and its effects carries emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument discusses well-known historical events but lacks specific details.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "The justice system is in drastic need of reform. Cops, prosecutors, police unions, where to even start at how bad they are? There is an endless war on drugs that my taxes pay for. There is rampant imprisonment of non-violent felons that my taxes pay for. There is an endless ghettoization of minorities that my taxes pay for. Do I want these things? No way! Do I vote against them every chance I get? Of course! Am I racist? Am I complicit? I don’t believe so. Let me hear it, reddit."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The overall tone is negative towards the justice system and its implications.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (This section is assertive, with the speaker declaring their opposition to the current system.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The language is passionate and carries a sense of urgency regarding social issues.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This section is very concrete, listing specific issues and personal actions taken against them.)

Overall, the ratings capture various dimensions of the argument as presented in each quarter, reflecting emotional tone, assertiveness, vividness, and specificity.
