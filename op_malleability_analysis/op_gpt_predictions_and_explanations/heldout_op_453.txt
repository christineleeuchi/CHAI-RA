**1st Quarter: "CMV: Wit is dead, and Reddit killed it. Corollary: It's become impossible to find any content of worth in threads not marked 'serious.'"**

- **Valence:** 0.2 - The sentiment is predominantly negative, expressing a bleak view on wit's status and Reddit's impact.
- **Dominance:** 0.4 - The argument is assertive, stating bold claims about wit and Reddit's role in it.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The emotional charge is moderate; the writer feels strongly but does not employ extreme language.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The ideas presented are relatively clear, though abstract in nature; they touch on the significance of 'serious' content.

- **Valence:** 0.1 - This section continues the negative tone, reinforcing the idea of wit being cliché.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The author takes a strong stance, claiming that wit's prevalence has rendered it worthless.

**4th Quarter: "The age of wit and snark is over, or in its twilight. Change my view."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 - Although the writer is expressing a strong opinion, there's a hint of an invitation for discussion, which lightens the tone slightly.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - This portion maintains a commanding presence but also opens up for counterarguments.
