Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text:

### Quarter 1:
*"CMV: I believe being inspired by other tattoos makes you unoriginal I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people from real life for inspiration."*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The sentiment is somewhat negative as it suggests a judgment about originality.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author expresses a personal belief strongly, indicating a sense of authority over the topic.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument's tone is moderately intense, conveying strong feelings about inspiration and originality.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The examples provided (magazines, websites, shows) offer tangible references, making the argument relatable.)

### Quarter 2:
*"Every time someone does something like that, I can't help but think less of their tattoo."*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This expresses a negative judgment towards the tattoo in question.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The statement appears personal but also suggests a shared sentiment.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a clear feeling of disappointment tied to this statement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Less concrete, as it discusses feelings rather than specific examples.)

### Quarter 3:
*"Many a times, I've seen a really nice tattoo and it's always a bittersweet feeling. On one hand it's a beautiful piece, on the other, I never want to have a similar one to that, as I'd feel I was just copying the other person."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 (A mix of positive (beautiful) and negative (bittersweet) sentiments.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Although introspective and personal, it lacks a strong authoritative tone.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The emotional conflict is strong, showing a deep internal struggle.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it discusses feelings, it touches on real experiences with tattoos.)

### Quarter 4:
*"Whenever I ask a friend why they picked a tattoo from a portfolio, their answer is never far from 'because I think it's cool', so elaborating beyond that would be best I suppose."*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This expresses a mild criticism of common reasoning.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The tone is more questioning and reflective rather than assertive.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a moderate level of concern about the reasoning behind tattoo choices.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The mention of friends and portfolios grounds the argument in real social interactions.)

Overall, these ratings reflect the emotional tone, authority, emotional strength, and clarity within each quarter of the argument.
