Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument you provided in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness in four quarters, I’ve broken it down accordingly:

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV: Utopia has come and gone, and can never be recovered. I believe that utopia is being one with the world in such a way that the struggle for survival is meaningful. As we take from the environment's resources, we give back with our death. I am referring to hunter-gatherer societies, before the advent of technology progressed as far as to allow us to settle down via agriculture. Back when labor was purely for survival, all other efforts were treasured and treated as divine. Art and music and expression were precious excesses that bound people closer to nature and the balance that had been struck between mankind and its environment."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The tone is somewhat neutral to positive regarding the past, contrasting it with a more negative modern perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The idea of utopia implies a desire for an ideal state, but it feels more reflective than authoritative.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The concepts discussed carry some emotional weight, particularly regarding the significance of survival and creativity in hunter-gatherer societies.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The reference to specific societal structures and concepts like art gives it a tangible feel.)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** "The modern world has destroyed that divinity. The moment that humanity became the greatest threat to itself is the moment that utopia was lost. Now those of us who are 'fortunate' enough to live in a 1st world nation ponder the meaning of our lives and the work we do. We grasp for luxury that ultimately does nothing but pitch our fortune against others in a meaningless display of power. Those left in the world who struggle to survive either do so against other humans, via the mechanics of capitalism or the horror of war, or they are admired and envied for the strength and longevity of their customs, for continuing to strike a balance with nature rather than using modern technologies to conquer it."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This section has a clear negative valence, criticizing modernity and capitalism.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker positions themselves as an observer of societal problems, though there's a sense of urgency in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The denunciation of modern life's emptiness and the implications of survival against capitalism and war carry high emotional intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (References to specific societal structures and experiences provide some grounding, though it remains abstract in larger philosophical terms.)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "True utopia is to face nature and face our mortality with acceptance, and to strike a balance with nature such that all life and life's labour has meaning. We have lost this balance forever, and our ultimate fate is probably extinction dealt from our own hand."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (The valence is largely negative, emphasizing loss and pessimism regarding humanity's fate.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (This section reflects a more assertive stance on the need to redefine utopia and our relationship with nature.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (The acceptance of mortality and the dire warning of potential extinction underscores a high emotional intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The concept of ‘striking a balance’ is abstract, although the pull towards facing nature adds some grounding.)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "And of course, the great irony is that we are nature's impulses incarnate. We are self-interested to a fault, as any natural life is. We somehow just ended up with the intellectual power to win nature's game, and this is what will keep us from utopia."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (While there is recognition of our nature, the commentary remains critical and somewhat cynical.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (There is a more philosophical assertion here, emphasizing humanity’s inherent nature and its consequences.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The irony noted and admission of self-interest infuse this section with notable emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (This part leans towards abstract philosophical ideas, though the notion of being "nature's impulses" serves as a concrete metaphor.)

### Summary Ratings:
- **1st Quarter:** Valence (0.5), Dominance (0.3), Intensity (0.6), Concreteness (0.7)
- **2nd Quarter:** Valence (0.2), Dominance (0.4), Intensity (0.8), Concreteness (0.6)
- **3rd Quarter:** Valence (0.1), Dominance (0.5), Intensity (0.9), Concreteness (0.5)
- **4th Quarter:** Valence (0.3), Dominance (0.6), Intensity (0.7), Concreteness (0.4)

These scores provide a framework for understanding the emotional and intellectual weight of the argument presented.
