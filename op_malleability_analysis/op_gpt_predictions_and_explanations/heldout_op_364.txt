Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the given criteria, we'll categorize it into four quarters and rate each on the scales of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. 

### Quarter 1:
*"CMV: People should not be able to live forever. Death is a necessary part of evolution and the natural life cycle. My girlfriend and I recently watched the documentary *The Immortalists* on netflix. The documentary is about scientific efforts to help humans reverse or even eliminate the aging process."*

- **Valence**: 0.7 (The assertion about immortality has a negative emotional tone as it implies death is necessary.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The argument establishes a viewpoint but acknowledges the ongoing scientific exploration of immortality.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The initial statement is firm, but the emotion conveyed is moderate rather than extreme.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The argument references a documentary which provides a concrete background but does not delve into detailed evidence yet.)

### Quarter 2:
*"One of the more promising avenues for doing this is through Telomerase Gene Therapy, which essentially helps to reverse natural degradation that occurs as our cells replicate (which contributes to the aging process). Although this sounds like science fiction and we haven't actually made anything immortal, scientists have already used telomerase gene therapy to extend the lives of mice by up to 24%."*

- **Valence**: 0.5 (This quarter is more neutral, presenting scientific facts without strong positive or negative connotations.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (While it provides scientific information, it does not assert dominance over the counterargument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The tone is factual, which reduces emotional engagement—there’s minimal intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (This section is highly concrete as it discusses a specific scientific approach and provides quantitative evidence from studies.)

### Quarter 3:
*"Getting old sucks, no question, and death is not a pleasant thing to deal with. But if nobody died of old age, our overpopulation concerns would be even more harrowing than they already are. New generations wouldn't replace old generations, they would just add to them."*

- **Valence**: 0.8 (Reflects strong negative feelings towards aging and death.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Clearly articulating the argument’s stance on the necessity of death and concerns with population growth.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (Emotionally charged language like "sucks" enhances intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (While it raises valid points, it lacks specific data or examples to back the argument about overpopulation.)

### Quarter 4:
*"Human society would change even more slowly than it already does, if at all (I mean just imagine how many people from the 18th century would still be alive, and what effect that might have on our current society). People need to be able to die, as terrible as death and aging can be."*

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Negative outlook on the consequences of immortality implies a need for death.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Offers a strong argument for the necessity of death but is still somewhat speculative.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Uses hypothetical scenarios to evoke thought but maintains a calm tone overall.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The argument is general and theoretical without specific supporting evidence to illustrate the points made.)

### Summary:
- **Quarter 1**: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 2**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.9
- **Quarter 3**: Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 4**: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5

These ratings aim to provide a nuanced assessment of the argument's emotional weight, assertiveness, engagement level, and the degree of specificity.
