Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I will analyze the content and tone present in each section. Here's the breakdown:

### Quarter 1: 
**Text:** "CMV: Spitting out junk food rather than swallowing it is not an eating disorder Preface: 6 months ago I was obese, 2 weeks ago I was overweight, today I am a healthy weight... all according to the BMI chart."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The tone is mostly positive, indicating progress and achievement in weight loss.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author presents their perspective confidently but is setting up an argument rather than dominating the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; the author shares personal change without extreme emotional expression.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The argument is concrete, supported by specific weight metrics and timeframes.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "I lost this weight deliberately and methodically, by calculating my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and eating at a 1000 calorie per day deficit in order to achieve about 2 pounds per week of weight loss."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive, as it emphasizes the methodical nature of the weight loss.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author asserts control over their weight loss strategy, demonstrating a sense of ownership.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The intensity increases as the author discusses their detailed approach to weight loss.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Very concrete; it includes specific calculations and targets.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "In order to help myself have the willpower to do this I started to allow myself to enjoy all of my favorite snacks and junk food but instead of swallowing I would spit it out..."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed; while the intention seems to be positive, the act described can be perceived negatively.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The author appears to have some control over their behaviors, but the action could suggest an unhealthy relationship with food.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity is heightened as the author describes a unique and unconventional method.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Moderately concrete; specific practices are mentioned but could be viewed as vague in terms of psychological impact.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "The problem started when I told a friend about this and they insisted that I had an eating disorder and needed to see a psychologist..."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative; reflecting conflict with a friend's reaction indicates distress.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author feels challenged by a friend's opinion, indicating a decrease in dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity due to the emotional weight of being misunderstood and feeling judged.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat concrete; the situation is relatable but less specific in its details and outcomes.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.8
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.9
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.5

These ratings reflect the overall tone and quality of the argument in relation to the specified metrics.
