Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Certainly! Below are the rating scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the four dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument's text.

## Quarter 1: "CMV: I like anecdotal evidence. Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it."

- **Valence**: 0.8 (Positive sentiment towards anecdotal evidence)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Expresses a personal preference, not overly assertive)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Mildly strong expression of preference)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Specific examples of seeking information)

## Quarter 2: "Why, then, is it looked down on and dismissed as anecdotal evidence for someone to share an experience of theirs?"

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; questioning the perception of anecdotal evidence)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Asking a question implies engagement with the topic)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate inquiry without high emotional charge)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (General question about perception)

## Quarter 3: "I quite enjoy listening to anecdotal evidence to get new perspectives I wouldn't have thought of or haven't heard before."

- **Valence**: 0.9 (Highly positive view of anecdotal evidence)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (More of a personal opinion rather than a directive)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Strong appreciation for new perspectives)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Specific about enjoying new perspectives)

## Quarter 4: "I understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning. Am I wrong about this?"

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative; acknowledges a limitation but defends anecdotal evidence)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Assertive in rejecting the dismissal of anecdotal evidence)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate emotional engagement)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Specific about the nature of anecdotal evidence and its limitations)

These ratings reflect the emotional tone, assertiveness, strength of expression, and clarity of the argument across its different parts.
