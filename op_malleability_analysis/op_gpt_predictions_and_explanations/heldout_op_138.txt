Here are the ratings for the four aspects (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) across the four quarters of the provided argument:

### 1st Quarter
* **Valence:** 0.2 - The tone is generally skeptical and negative about the idea of being an educated voter.
* **Dominance:** 0.4 - The writer's perspective is assertive but acknowledges the common expectation of educated voters.
* **Intensity:** 0.5 - There's a moderate intensity in expressing concern about political ignorance.
* **Concreteness:** 0.3 - The argument is abstract, discussing perceptions rather than providing specific examples.

### 2nd Quarter
* **Valence:** 0.2 - Continues a skeptical tone, emphasizing the complexity of political decision-making.
* **Dominance:** 0.5 - The discussion is more dominant here as the author expresses personal opinions and dilemmas.
* **Intensity:** 0.7 - The intensity increases as the author articulates the struggle of navigating the political landscape.
* **Concreteness:** 0.4 - Introduces specific issues in education, but remains largely theoretical.

### 3rd Quarter
* **Valence:** 0.3 - Shares a slightly more neutral view by framing discussions on accountability standards.
* **Dominance:** 0.4 - Maintaining a reflective tone, acknowledging multiple perspectives.
* **Intensity:** 0.6 - The intensity holds as the author emphasizes the long-term impacts of their uncertainties.
* **Concreteness:** 0.5 - A bit more concrete than before, as it relates to specific policies and systems, though still abstract.

### 4th Quarter
* **Valence:** 0.2 - Returns to a negative sentiment, reinforcing the impossibility of being fully informed as a voter.
* **Dominance:** 0.6 - A more assertive stance that draws conclusions from the earlier argument.
* **Intensity:** 0.8 - High intensity with a clear expression of frustration about voting expectations.
* **Concreteness:** 0.4 - While it mentions various aspects of governance, the lack of specificity remains.

These ratings reflect a progression from skepticism and uncertainty to a solid assertion of frustration about the voting process and political complexity, while maintaining a continued sense of abstraction throughout the argument.
