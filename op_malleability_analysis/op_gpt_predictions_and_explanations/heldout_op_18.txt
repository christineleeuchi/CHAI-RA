Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the four categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument, I'll provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each.

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (The argument starts off negatively, presenting a viewpoint that can be interpreted as dismissive towards those who defend obligated coverage for pre-existing conditions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion on the matter, showcasing a firm stance against the defenses of Obamacare.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a moderate level of intensity in the critique of businesses and their motivations.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it lays out the premise, it lacks specific examples or deeper exploration of evidence.)

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Continues with a negative view, emphasizing the profit-driven nature of corporations, which could be seen as harsh.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker’s perspective is dominant, clearly stating the belief that corporations operate solely for profit.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity increases as the speaker dismissively addresses corporate responsibilities and moral obligations.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat concrete; it reflects a general understanding of how businesses operate, though not with specific case studies or data.)

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Maintains a negative valence, especially when discussing the “worst customer” as a target for exclusion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.9 (Very assertive, categorically labeling certain individuals as a “terrible investment” showcases strong dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The intensity spikes with the use of hypotheticals and characterizations of individuals as bad investments.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Utilizes specific characteristics to illustrate the problematic customer, making it more concrete.)

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Here, it opens up a consideration for government intervention, albeit still negative about the current systems.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker acknowledges the government's role but still expresses a definitive opinion on the insurance companies’ right to choose.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity has diminished slightly as the speaker is contemplating rather than solely critiquing.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete as it suggests a potential solution, signaling an understanding of the broader implications.)

Overall, the argument appears to be strongly opinionated, featuring distinct elements of negativity, clear dominance, varied intensity, and a mix of concrete examples and general assertions.
