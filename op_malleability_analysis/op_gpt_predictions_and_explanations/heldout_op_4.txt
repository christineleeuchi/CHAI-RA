Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we'll break it down into four quarters and assess each aspect. 

### Quarter 1:
*"CMV: Intelligent people cannot be sad because if they're intelligent they'll figure out a way to cheer up."*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The statement implies a positive belief about intelligence but dismisses the validity of emotions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker presents a confident assertion about the relationship between intelligence and sadness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The statement carries a moderate level of intensity; it is a firm opinion but not extremely passionate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (While it mentions intelligence in relation to sadness, it lacks specific examples or evidence.)

### Quarter 2:
*"Lately I've been a bit sad most of the time and I've thought that if I were more intelligent I wouldn't be sad because I would know what to do in order to cheer myself up."*

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This expresses personal sadness, leading to a negative emotional tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker is reflecting on their own experience, indicating some vulnerability.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There's a higher intensity as the speaker expresses personal feelings of sadness.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The personal experience adds a degree of concreteness, but it's still abstract in terms of actionable steps.)

### Quarter 3:
*"I have been thinking that intelligent people are happier than average-minded people because their brains tell them what to do for not being sad; however average-minded people don't know what to do and they may feel inferior in regards to smart people."*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This has a mixed tone, acknowledging a hierarchy that suggests average-minded people experience negative feelings.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument is presented with some authority, indicating the speakerâ€™s perspective on intelligence and happiness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity in discussing the comparison; it is neither overly dramatic nor completely neutral.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This quarter includes a comparison that is more specific, but it still lacks solid evidence.)

### Quarter 4:
*"In addition, I think that for an average-minded person it'd be very difficult to become as smart as a person who was 'born smart'."*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This suggests a negative outlook for average-minded individuals, which adds some negative valence but acknowledges possibility for growth.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The statement implies a strong belief in innate intelligence, presenting a somewhat dominant viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity remains moderately high, expressing a belief without significant emotional escalation.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While this does discuss a concept of inherent intelligence, it's somewhat abstract regarding the implications.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
