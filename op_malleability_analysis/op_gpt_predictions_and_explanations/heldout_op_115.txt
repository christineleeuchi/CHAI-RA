Here are the rating scores for each quarter of the argument you provided:

1. **Valence**:
   - **Score**: 0.6
   - **Reasoning**: The overall sentiment expresses a desire for improvement and success, indicating a positive motivation. However, there is also a recognition of potential drawbacks, contributing to a slightly mixed emotional tone.

2. **Dominance**:
   - **Score**: 0.4
   - **Reasoning**: The author seems uncertain and is seeking validation from others to change their view. This indicates a lower level of dominance as they present themselves as open and somewhat indecisive.

3. **Intensity**:
   - **Score**: 0.5
   - **Reasoning**: The argument displays a moderate level of intensity. There is a clear urgency in wanting to improve grades and get into a good college, but the mention of a willingness to discuss the idea reflects a balanced rather than heated intensity.

4. **Concreteness**:
   - **Score**: 0.7
   - **Reasoning**: The argument presents specific aspects, such as attending private school, taking high classes, and aiming for a particular college. These concrete goals enhance the clarity of the author's perspective.

These scores are subjective assessments based on the content of the argument. Different evaluators may interpret the text differently based on individual perspectives.
