Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on the requested dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—let’s break down each quarter of the argument and provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each aspect.

### Quarter 1: 
"CMV: There is a 'Normal' state and Homosexuality and Autism and the like are irregular states. "Normal"

(adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (The statement is neutral in tone but sets a potentially negative frame for the identities of homosexuality and autism).
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The assertion about a 'Normal' state suggests an authoritative stance about what is considered normal).
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Mildly evocative, mainly because of the term "irregular states", which can be seen as provoking a reaction).
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The definition of 'normal' is clear and straightforward).

### Quarter 2:
"By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a 'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various 'Normal' states to make up a 'Normal' human being."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Still largely neutral but reinforces a binary perspective that may evoke discomfort).
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Confident assertion that establishes a systematic view of human diversity).
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Less intense than the first quarter, as it merely builds on the previous points).
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete argument reinforcing the concept of a 'Normal' state).

### Quarter 3:
"Anything that is in the majority is a 'Normal' state. So, the 'Normal' human being is a Cisgendered, Heterosexual, Chinese man."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Somewhat negative as it explicitly names a particular type of individual, marginalizing others).
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong claim about who constitutes the 'Normal' human being).
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Stronger intensity as it labels a specific demographic as the norm).
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Highly concrete due to the specific classification stated).

### Quarter 4:
"This means that states such as Transgender, Homosexual, Autistic etc. are not 'Normal'. They are in fact 'different'. and we desperately need to stop acting as if they are normal. They are different."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The tone indicates a need for distinction, which can feel exclusionary; however, it also emphasizes that these are not bad states).
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Claiming that society needs to adjust its view on normalcy with a degree of authority).
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (More intense call to action that highlights the need for a societal perception adjustment).
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Concrete due to clear identification of what is deemed 'different').

### Summary of Scores:
**Quarter 1:**
- Valence: 0.1
- Dominance: 0.6
- Intensity: 0.5
- Concreteness: 0.7

**Quarter 2:**
- Valence: 0.2
