Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument provided, I will rate each of the following dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the argument's text.

### First Quarter:
**Text:** "CMV: Companies should be legally liable for not promptly responding to security patches Specifically with the Android mobile OS and recent hacks like [this](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/27/426613020/major-flaw-in-android-phones-would-let-hackers-in-with-just-a-text) one..."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The argument presents a negative view of companies' responses, suggesting a need for legal liability. The tone is somewhat critical.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The writer asserts a strong opinion on the legal responsibility of companies, indicating a clear authority on the matter.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The urgency in the phrasing about legal liability and the mention of recent hacks increases the intensity of the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument refers to specific examples, such as Android and a recent hack, making it concrete but still somewhat general in its implications for liability.)

### Second Quarter:
**Text:** "Google is very fond of wringing their hands and saying how they patched their upstream OS, but it's up to Device Manufacturers and Carriers to roll their own releases..."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The use of "wringing their hands" is critical, but the mention of the challenges posed by manufacturers and carriers balances the negativity slightly.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author holds a strong position, emphasizing the shifting responsibility from Google to manufacturers and carriers.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The discussion of the gaps in updates adds intensity but is less emotionally charged than other parts of the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument directly addresses the roles of specific companies and the impact of their actions, providing concrete examples.)

### Third Quarter:
**Text:** "Since most carriers lock their phone OS, it is literally not possible to LEGALLY patch your phone due to the restrictions of the DMCA..."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (This section strongly criticizes the legal situation and the consequences for consumers, expressing frustration and urgency.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author asserts a clear position regarding the legal constraints, exhibiting a confident stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Describing the legal implications for consumers heightens the emotional impact, making it feel urgent and serious.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (There are clear references to the DMCA and the practical implications it has for users, enhancing the argument's concreteness.)

### Fourth Quarter:
**Text:** "More and more of our personal data and digital lives live on our phones... but maybe it's time to open up liability for unpatched security flaws."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The argument presents a concern for consumer safety, maintaining a critical tone towards industry practices.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (While it asserts the need for change, it is more exploratory at this point, considering the implications of liability.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The reference to personal data heightens the stakes in the argument, implying the potential consequences of inaction.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While it refers to personal data security, the conclusion feels broader and less concrete than previous sections.)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **First Quarter:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6
- **Second Quarter:** Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.7
- **Third Quarter:** Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.8
