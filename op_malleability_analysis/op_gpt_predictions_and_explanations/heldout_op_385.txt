Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument presented, I will provide a rating for each of the four dimensions: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. I will assess each of these dimensions for each quarter of the argument's text.

### 1st Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.2 - The argument presents a negative view of the military's purpose, focusing on killing and destruction, which can be perceived as unfavorable.
**Dominance:** 0.6 - The author presents a strong opinion and asserts their view confidently, showing a level of authority in their belief.
**Intensity:** 0.7 - The language used is assertive and direct (e.g., "totally to kill people and break things"), indicating a high level of intensity in the argument.
**Concreteness:** 0.8 - The argument contains specific references to military equipment and roles, providing a tangible basis for its claims.

### 2nd Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.1 - The continued focus on the negative aspects of military purpose further diminishes positive perception.
**Dominance:** 0.7 - The tone remains strong and assertive, reinforcing the author's dominance in the argument.
**Intensity:** 0.8 - The argument maintains a high intensity, especially with phrases like "yep, but it's also absolutely true."
**Concreteness:** 0.9 - Specificity in describing roles and functions within the military (e.g., cooks and mechanics) enhances the concreteness of the argument.

### 3rd Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.2 - The rhetorical questioning implies a critique of opposing views, maintaining a negative valence.
**Dominance:** 0.7 - There is a strong presence of authority in the author's voice, dismissing counterarguments.
**Intensity:** 0.6 - The intensity remains high, but the argument shows slight moderation as it acknowledges differing perceptions.
**Concreteness:** 0.7 - The argument presents some specific examples (e.g., the Internet's development) but is slightly less concrete than earlier sections.

### 4th Quarter:
**Valence:** 0.3 - The conclusion continues to focus on destruction, carrying a negative tone, though with an acceptance of reality.
**Dominance:** 0.8 - The speakerâ€™s confidence is at its peak, reinforcing their claim as the final conclusion is presented.
**Intensity:** 0.7 - The concluding statements retain a strong intensity, emphasizing the main point again and using phrases like "that's their real purpose."
**Concreteness:** 0.6 - The concluding thoughts are more abstract, reiterating the military's purpose rather than providing new examples or details.

### Summary:
- **1st Quarter:**
  - Valence: 0.2
  - Dominance: 0.6
  - Intensity: 0.7
  - Concreteness: 0.8
- **2nd Quarter:**
  - Valence: 0.1
  - Dominance: 0.7
  - Intensity: 0.8
  - Concreteness: 0.9
- **3rd Quarter:**
  - Valence: 0.2
  - Dominance: 0.7
  - Intensity: 0.6
  - Concreteness: 0.7
- **4th Quarter:**
  - Valence: 0.3
  - Dominance: 0.8
  - Intensity: 0.7
  - Concreteness: 0.6

These ratings illustrate the complex nature of the argument, including its negative stance, strong assertiveness, high intensity, and varying levels of concreteness throughout the text.
