Here are the rating scores for the four quarters of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**Quarter 1:**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (The speaker expresses negative feelings and self-doubt, leading to a low positive valence.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker feels subordinate to peers and focuses on what they perceive as inadequacies.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The emotions conveyed are strong, reflecting deep personal struggles.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The speaker mentions specific factors contributing to their feelings of inadequacy, but the overall sentiment is abstract.)

**Quarter 2:**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (This quarter has a neutral to slightly positive tone as it lists good qualities, reflecting some self-acceptance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (There is a balance between acknowledging positive traits and the negative self-perception.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The self-acknowledgment is moderate, looking at strengths with some hope.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The qualities mentioned are specific and tangible, making this part feel more concrete.)

**Quarter 3:**
- **Valence:** 0.1 (A distinctly negative view is presented, with despair about perceived social attractiveness.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker feels defeated, focusing on their shortcomings.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity is high as the speaker expresses frustration and hopelessness.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Mentioning specific attributes like "small dick" and "35K a year" adds a concrete element.)

**Quarter 4:**
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is somewhat more positive as the speaker shows openness to change and gratitude for support.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (There is a shift towards being more empowered, expressing a desire for improvement.)
