Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on the provided criteria (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), I will break it down into four quarters and assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each.

### Quarter 1: 
"CMV: Churches should lose tax exempt status and monies gained should be put towards social programs."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive for social programs, but negative towards churches' tax status)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument asserts a strong opinion against churches’ tax-exempt status)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The language is assertive and conveys a clear belief)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The concept of tax exemption is abstract, but there is a clear implication of financial resources)

### Quarter 2:
"I firmly believe if we put tax dollars we receive from churches toward social programs be it after school programs for children, education or even possibly low cost clinics for people we would be able to raise the standard of life for the working class citizens."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive; focuses on raising standards of living)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (While it expresses a belief, it’s somewhat speculative)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong conviction in the belief stated)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Reference to specific programs makes it more concrete)

### Quarter 3: 
"This would help at least the religion I am familiar with (Christianity) meet some of their tenets of giving to those in need and sacrificing personal wealth for the good of those less fortunate."

- **Valence:** 0.9 (Positive, aligns well with altruistic values)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less dominant as it relates to specific religious tenets)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Strong belief but somewhat diluted by reference to religious principles)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concepts of giving and sacrifice are moral but somewhat abstract)

### Quarter 4: 
"In the event churches would be operating at a loss instead of a profit or are just breaking even they could receive a break by having either the congregation doing volunteer work or donating to the local community therefor almost achieving the same effect as if it were to pay taxes by still actively helping in the community."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive overall, encouraging community involvement)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate; presents an alternative but conditional approach)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity; somewhat less assertive than previous sections)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Business operations and community actions provide concrete elements)

### Summary of Ratings:
1. **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
2. **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7
3. **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.9, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6
4. **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.7
