Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument based on the criteria requested—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I will analyze each quarter of the text separately. 

**1st Quarter: "CMV: The truth of an idea should matter more than its politics What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc."**

- **Valence (0.6):** The argument has a predominantly positive tone toward the pursuit of truth, though it also touches on negative political ramifications.
- **Dominance (0.3):** The argument asserts a philosophical standpoint, indicating a certain degree of ideological dominance, but is not confrontational.
- **Intensity (0.5):** There is a moderate intensity, as the author is making a strong claim about the importance of truth.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** The ideas presented are clear and concrete in advocating for truth over politics.

**2nd Quarter: "Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy the idea undermines, and they have no bearing on truth, which should be the only thing that determines the believability of an idea."**

- **Valence (0.5):** This quarter is somewhat neutral but leans slightly negative, as it discusses power dynamics.
- **Dominance (0.4):** The argument maintains a philosophical position but doesn’t assert dominance over a specific ideology.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The claim that political aspects don't affect truth is stated forcefully, adding to intensity.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The argument remains clear and defined, though it becomes slightly abstract when discussing power dynamics.

**3rd Quarter: "Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people."**

- **Valence (0.4):** This is a negative statement due to the content discussing racism.
- **Dominance (0.5):** By presenting a controversial claim, there's a challenge to prevailing narratives about race and ability, showing a level of ideological engagement.
- **Intensity (0.7):** The intensity is high due to the controversial nature of the claim and its potential societal implications.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** This idea is concrete in the sense that it presents a specific claim, but it hinges on controversial premises.

**4th Quarter: "It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes. I should believe this idea because evidence supports it, and not be afraid of the power dynamics it may disrupt. That is *intellectual integrity*."**

- **Valence (0.3):** This portion has a negative connotation given the context of racial comparisons and implications.
- **Dominance (0.6):** It displays an assertion of belief in a particular viewpoint that runs counter to common social narratives, suggesting a form of intellectual dominance.
- **Intensity (0.8):** The intensity is high as the author strongly asserts their belief in the validity of the claim due to evidence.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** While the example is specific, the broader assertion about intellectual integrity adds a layer of abstraction.

**Summary Scores:**
- **1st Quarter:** Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.3, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7
- **2nd Quarter:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6
- **3rd Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
- **4th Quarter:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.6
