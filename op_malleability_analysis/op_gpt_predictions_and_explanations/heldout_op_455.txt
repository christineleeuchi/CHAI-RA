Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll analyze each point of the argument as requested:

**Point 1:**
- **Valence (0.7):** The argument presents a generally positive view on requiring IDs, emphasizing efficiency over inefficiency in voter verification.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The writer asserts their perspective with a degree of authority, focusing on the logistical challenges of not requiring IDs.
- **Intensity (0.5):** The intensity is moderate; the language used conveys a sense of frustration about inefficiencies but doesnâ€™t evoke strong emotional responses.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The argument includes specific references to inefficiencies in identity verification, which gives it a sense of tangible reality, but doesn't offer detailed examples.

**Point 2:**
- **Valence (0.5):** This point is more neutral. It critiques the counterargument regarding discrimination but does not express strong positivity or negativity.
- **Dominance (0.7):** The writer displays a confident stance by challenging existing arguments against ID requirements.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The intensity increases when the writer dismisses those without IDs as irresponsible, showing some emotional undertones.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** The argument is abstract, relying on generalizations about people's behaviors without providing specific statistical support or detailed examples.

**Point 3:**
- **Valence (0.7):** This point leans positive on requiring IDs to improve the voting experience, suggesting it would alleviate long lines.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The writer presents a strong perspective, framing the argument around the practical implications of not requiring IDs.
- **Intensity (0.5):** There is moderate intensity in discussing the impact on working individuals but less emotional engagement compared to previous points.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The mention of part-time employees and employer practices makes the argument more concrete, illustrating real-world implications.

**Point 4:**
- **Valence (0.6):** This point reflects a positive outlook on the feasibility of providing free ID cards, contrasting it with more expensive social programs.
- **Dominance (0.5):** The dominance is somewhat balanced, as it calls for practical reforms without dismissing larger social issues entirely.
- **Intensity (0.4):** The intensity is low; the language is more analytical and less emotionally charged than earlier points.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The argument is concrete in its suggestion of a specific policy change (providing free IDs) and compares it to other large-scale funding issues.
