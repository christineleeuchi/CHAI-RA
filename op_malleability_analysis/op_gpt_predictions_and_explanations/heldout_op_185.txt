Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will consider each quarter of the text separately. 

**Quarter 1: “CMV: Private business should be able to do or not do business with whoever they want. I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason.”**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment is negative due to the implication of discrimination.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker expresses a strong opinion but acknowledges the opposing viewpoint implicitly.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument is delivered with a strong conviction regarding the right of businesses.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is somewhat abstract but starts to lay the framework for discussion.)

**Quarter 2: “For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, then they should be able to.”**

- **Valence:** 0.1 (The example reflects a very negative connotation and promotes exclusion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (While it presents a dominant opinion, it also invokes significant ethical concerns.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (This statement evokes strong feelings about racial discrimination.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This provides a specific scenario that grounds the argument but in a controversial way.)

**Quarter 3: “As a private citizen, I can choose who I give my business to. If I'm a racist, I can choose to only give my business to my race.”**

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This maintains a negative sentiment due to the reference to racism.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The claim of personal choice is an assertion of individual autonomy.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is significant intensity through the assertion of personal values.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The argument is somewhat abstract and hinges on individual choice without clear examples.)

**Quarter 4: “If I personally want to give money to the homeless, I can choose to give it to one race/orientation/etc. or another. Why can't a private business make the same decision? The free market place should solve this problem because people would see a need to service those that are refused service and then start a competing business.”**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Reaffirms negative implications of discrimination, though relates back to market dynamics.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The framing of market dynamics as a solution holds some weight against opposing views.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity as it promotes the free market as a remedy.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument references specific market principles but remains abstract regarding application.)

These scores reflect the tone and clarity of each part of the argument while considering the societal context surrounding the topics discussed.
