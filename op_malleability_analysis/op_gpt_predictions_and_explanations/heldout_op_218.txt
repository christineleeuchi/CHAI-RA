Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To analyze the argument using the specified criteria—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—let’s examine each quarter of the text individually and assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0.

**Quarter 1: "CMV: I don't like tipping."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative sentiment towards tipping)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Expresses personal opinion, but not very strong or commanding)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderately intense, straightforward dislike)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Clear and direct statement)

**Quarter 2: "Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly."**
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to slightly negative, critiquing the tipping culture)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (More assertive in expressing a viewpoint)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately intense in discussing the implications of tipping)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Somewhat abstract because it's discussing cultural norms)

**Quarter 3: "I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the food, but isn't that exactly what they're paid for? To give a paying customer a good service?"**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Balanced view acknowledging both sides)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Poses a rhetorical question, engaging the listener)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Stronger intensity due to the challenge of the expectation to tip)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Specific discussion about job responsibilities)

**Quarter 4: "Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages, but why should I have to fork out more of my money that I'm already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here, to get her up to normal living wage? Isn't that a governmental issue of poverty/low wages?"**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative view, especially towards the idea of tipping as a solution)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Assertive in asking why the burden falls on the customer)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity, as it expresses frustration about personal financial responsibility)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Discusses specific individuals and general societal issues but remains somewhat abstract)

Overall, these scores reflect the argument's shifting sentiment and engagement with the topic of tipping, service wages, and personal responsibility.
