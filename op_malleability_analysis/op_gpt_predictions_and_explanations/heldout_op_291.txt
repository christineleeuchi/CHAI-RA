Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating for the specified dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—for each quarter of your argument, I'll analyze the text as follows:

### Quarter 1: Introduction of the Argument
**Text:** "CMV: Open carry of guns in the United States is foolish and it causes more trouble than good..."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The tone is negative, criticizing open carry practices.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author asserts a strong opinion against open carry, suggesting a firm stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The use of words like "foolish" indicates a high level of intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Concepts are somewhat abstract here, focusing on the notion of "trouble" without specifics at this point.)

### Quarter 2: Fear and Safety Concerns
**Text:** "...makes people fear for their safety. The United States has a long history of incidents..."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (The statement points towards fear, which is a negative emotional response.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The author provides concerns, showing influence but not dominance over the reader's interpretation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The mention of mass shootings elevates the emotional intensity significantly.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This quarter includes concrete examples related to public safety and mass shootings, adding clarity.)

### Quarter 3: Impact on Police Resources
**Text:** "...diverts police from doing their primary jobs..."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negatively framed regarding the impact on police duties.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author asserts a clear claim about police responsibility being compromised.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (While it is concern-driven, the tone is less charged here compared to the previous points.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear and specific about the repercussions for police work and public safety.)

### Quarter 4: Responsibility and Vague Protest Methods
**Text:** "...makes gun owners look bad... It's a vague way to protest..."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Moderately negative since it emphasizes the irresponsibility of open carry actions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author maintains their stance, expressing disappointment towards the methods used in protest.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The concern is palpable, but it is balanced with an analysis of the effectiveness of the protest.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The author provides arguments that are logically structured, highlighting both individual and community impacts.)

### Summary of Ratings:
| Quarter       | Valence | Dominance | Intensity | Concreteness |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Quarter 1     | 0.2     | 0.6       | 0.7       | 0.4          |
| Quarter 2     | 0.1     | 0.5       | 0.8       | 0.6          |
| Quarter 3     | 0.2     | 0.7       | 0.6       | 0.7          |
| Quarter 4     | 0.3     | 0.6       | 0.5       | 0.6          |

This breakdown captures the nuances of the argument presented in each quarter.
