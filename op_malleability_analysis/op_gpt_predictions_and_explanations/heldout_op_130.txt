Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide ratings for each quarter of the argument regarding valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break down the text into four parts and analyze each part. These ratings will be from 0.0 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest).

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "CMV: Capital punishment is ethically untenable and should be abolished where it is currently practiced. I am basing this opinion on several points. To begin with, my view is a natural consequence of my personal belief that **every human being has a right on living**..."

**Valence:** 0.8 (The argument expresses a strong positive view on the right to life and negative feelings towards capital punishment.)
**Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument presents a clear assertion but does not exert overwhelming dominance.)
**Intensity:** 0.7 (The language is assertive but also incorporates personal belief, thus showing a moderate level of intensity.)
**Concreteness:** 0.5 (It introduces concepts but lacks specific examples in this section.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "The death penalty is strictly opposed to this tenet. While some people may agree, that by commiting certain crimes such as child molestation, mass murder, et al. forfeit their basic human rights, this is a highly subjective point of view that cannot be unambiguously established..."

**Valence:** 0.7 (It maintains a strong negative view on capital punishment while also questioning opposing views.)
**Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument challenges subjective opinions but is somewhat moderate in its dominance.)
**Intensity:** 0.6 (The language is strong yet measured, expressing disapproval without extreme emotional appeal.)
**Concreteness:** 0.6 (It discusses subjective opinions with a moderate level of concreteness but could benefit from specific examples.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "Another reason why Capital Punishment should be abolished, is that it is not a punishment in real terms, but merely a 'solution', to satisfy the immediate need for equal retaliation according to the principle of 'an eye for an eye'..."

**Valence:** 0.9 (This section strongly criticizes capital punishment, contributing to a very negative valence.)
**Dominance:** 0.7 (It asserts a clear moral position against capital punishment that is difficult to contradict.)
**Intensity:** 0.8 (The language is strong and emotive, highlighting moral conflict, thus showing a high intensity.)
**Concreteness:** 0.7 (While it presents a clear argument, it could still benefit from additional examples or references.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Furthermore, the fact that death is a final event - an irreversible one - means, that juridical mistakes have much bigger consequences. If an innocent is erroneously put under arrest for years, he can still be released and even compensated once his innocence has been proven..."

**Valence:** 0.9 (Very strong negative valence against the irreversible nature of capital punishment.)
**Dominance:** 0.6 (It presents a logical and ethical stance, but does not assert as much dominance as in the previous section.)
**Intensity:** 0.7 (The tone is serious and impactful, indicating high emotional weight but not excessively so.)
**Concreteness:** 0.9 (Highly concrete, as it discusses irreversible consequences with clear logic and an example of wrongful conviction.)

### Summary Scores
- **Quarter 1**: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 2**: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 3**: Valence 0.9, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7
- **Quarter 4**: Valence 0.9, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.9

The overall impression of the argument shows a strong ethical stance against capital punishment while addressing important concerns regarding human rights, morality, and legal implications.
