**Valence (0.0 to 1.0)**: This measures the positivity or negativity of the sentiment expressed in the text.

1. **First Quarter**: 0.7 - The argument starts off positively by asserting Times New Roman is a good font, although it acknowledges a common negative view towards it.
2. **Second Quarter**: 0.6 - There’s a hint of frustration (slap on the wrist) but the overall sentiment remains somewhat positive regarding the font itself.
3. **Third Quarter**: 0.8 - This part reinforces the positive attributes of Times New Roman, emphasizing its readability and effectiveness.
4. **Fourth Quarter**: 0.5 - The discussion of licensing and Microsoft's decision has a more neutral tone, analyzing reasons behind the font's negative perception.

**Dominance (0.0 to 1.0)**: This measures the degree to which the speaker expresses control or assertiveness in the argument.

1. **First Quarter**: 0.6 - The speaker is assertive but also acknowledges the counterargument regarding overuse.
2. **Second Quarter**: 0.7 - The speaker shows more confidence and stands against the criticism received.
3. **Third Quarter**: 0.8 - This section displays a strong assertiveness in defending Times New Roman against Arial and praises its qualities.
4. **Fourth Quarter**: 0.4 - This part is more analytical and less assertive; it's focused on reasoning rather than strong claims.

**Intensity (0.0 to 1.0)**: This measures the strength or passion conveyed in the argument.

4. **Fourth Quarter**: 0.4 - The tone is calmer, focusing on logical reasoning without high emotional intensity.
