Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument presented about age of consent laws based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will provide scores for each quarter of the text.

### Quarter 1 
**Text Excerpt**: 
"CMV: Age of consent laws are based on faulty anecdotes Age of consent laws around the world vary dramatically, and even within the US there is a wide range of things that are acceptable or unacceptable depending on what state you are in. Most people are in support of age of consent laws, and will very aggressively assert that they want to protect the children. Many people will tell you that a sexual relationship between an adult and a child who is X years old is unquestionably damaging to the child, where X is usually a completely arbitrary number."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (Neutral/Negative - discussing contentious topic, though acknowledging varying perspectives)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (Moderate assertiveness about the anecdotal nature of laws)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Strong assertions about the arbitrary nature of age limits)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Examples provided, but still quite abstract)

### Quarter 2 
**Text Excerpt**: 
"There is no doubt to me that an adult is capable of abusing a child in a relationship, and that the adult is capable of abusing the child in a way that the child believes they are consenting and does not believe they are being abused. I also believe that adults are capable of doing this to each other in relationships where both people are of the consenting age."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (Negative - focus on abuse)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Moderate assertiveness in stating capability of abuse)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (High intensity discussing potential for abuse)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (General principles mentioned, lacking specific examples)

### Quarter 3 
**Text Excerpt**: 
"Where things start to get shaky is the point when people start asserting that all sexual relationships are abusive once the 'victim' is below a certain age. I do not believe that there is sufficient scientific evidence to back up this claim. I do not believe that healthy sexual relationships occurring between adults and teens or children are given the proper room to breathe or prosper: as soon as a child is discovered to be in a sexual relationship with an adult, that child will be told repeatedly that their sexual partner is a bad person and that their sexual partner has abused them. I believe that this alone is sufficient to damage the child, regardless of whether the sexual relationship itself was damaging. Children are highly vulnerable to suggestion."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (Negative - questioning societal assumptions)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (More assertive about need for rigorous evidence)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (High intensity with strong convictions about the influence of societal narratives)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Some specifics, but relies heavily on generalizations)

### Quarter 4 
**Text Excerpt**: 
"I believe that more rigorous scientific investigation is necessary to justify the age of consent laws, and that once the scientific evidence comes out, the age of consent laws should be adjusted accordingly. I know that, as a teenage boy, especially by 14 (but even, to a smaller degree, as early as 8 or 9) I would have been excited to engage in a sexual relationship with an attractive female. I don't see how this would have resulted in abuse or psychological damage (assuming, of course, that my partner had my best interests in mind). But that's just the problem, it's nothing more than an anecdote. People who oppose my views also provide anecdotes."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (Neutral - a mix of personal experience and skepticism)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strongly advocates for scientific investigation)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (High intensity in calling for change and adjustment of laws)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Includes personal anecdote but still lacks broader evidence)

### Summary of Scores

| Quarter | Valence | Dominance | Intensity | Concreteness |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1       | 0.3     | 0.4       | 0.5       | 0.4          |
| 2       | 0.2     | 0.5       | 0.6       | 0.5          |
| 3       | 0.3     | 0.6       | 0.7       | 0.4          |
| 4       | 0.4     | 0.7       | 0.6       | 0.5          |

This evaluation provides insight into the argumentative nature, emotional undertones, and clarity of the points being expressed throughout the text.
