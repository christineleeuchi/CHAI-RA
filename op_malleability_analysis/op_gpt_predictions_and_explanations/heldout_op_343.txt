Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I'll divide the argument into parts and analyze each one.

1. **First Quarter:**
   - **Text:** "CMV: Warning labels that state the obvious should be removed from consumer products."
   - **Valence:** 0.7 (The statement has a generally positive connotation regarding efficiency and common sense.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (The writer expresses an assertive opinion about the unnecessary nature of certain labels.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; the argument begins but has not yet reached a strong emotional peak.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The idea is concrete in its focus on warning labels, but it types into a broader discussion of consumer behavior.)

2. **Second Quarter:**
   - **Text:** "On a hair dryer: 'Do not use in a shower.' If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to a warning label!"
   - **Valence:** 0.4 (This suggests a negative view of consumers, which can diminish its overall positive tone.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument takes a stronger stance against the intelligence of some consumers.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (The use of "dumb enough" raises the emotional intensity.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very specific example that illustrates the point clearly.)

3. **Third Quarter:**
   - **Text:** "Really those things only exist because corporations are so afraid of frivolous lawsuits that could have been avoided if the consumer had only applied common sense in the first place."
   - **Valence:** 0.3 (A negative sentiment towards corporations and consumer behavior is expressed.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong critique of both corporations and consumer defaults.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity, with a clear emotional underpinning about the legal climate and consumer responsibility.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concepts like lawsuits and corporate fear are concrete issues.)

4. **Fourth Quarter:**
   - **Text:** "So I say corporations should be allowed to remove warning labels that would be obvious if one applies common sense without fear of litigation when Darwin strikes again."
   - **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral overall but leans toward positive in advocating for common sense.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.9 (Very strong, confident statement on the rights of corporations.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.8 (The reference to Darwinism adds a dramatic flair, increasing emotional weight.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The idea remains concrete but once again shifts from specific examples to a broader philosophical argument.)

**Summary:**
1. **First Quarter:**  
   - Valence: 0.7  
   - Dominance: 0.6  
   - Intensity: 0.5  
   - Concreteness: 0.6

   - Dominance: 0.7  
   - Intensity: 0.6

3. **Third Quarter:**  
   - Valence: 0.3  
   - Dominance: 0.8  
   - Intensity: 0.7

4. **Fourth Quarter:**  
   - Valence: 0.5  
   - Dominance: 0.9  
   - Intensity: 0.8  
   - Concreteness: 0.6
