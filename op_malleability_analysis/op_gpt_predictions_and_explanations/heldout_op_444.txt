Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here’s a rating score for each of the four dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument provided:

### First Quarter:
- **Valence (0.7)**: The argument conveys a strong sense of urgency and necessity for a minimum wage increase, which reflects a positive valence towards upliftment.
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The author asserts their opinion strongly, taking a dominant stance on the necessity of the proposed wage increase.
- **Intensity (0.8)**: The language used (e.g., "America desperately needs") conveys a high level of intensity and urgency.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The language is somewhat abstract as it discusses concepts like "minimum wage increase" without specific examples immediately.

### Second Quarter:
- **Valence (0.8)**: The statement "Earning less than $10/an hour is akin to slave labor" reflects a highly negative valence towards the current situation, viewing it as unjust.
- **Dominance (0.7)**: The personal anecdote and bold declarations give the author a strong, persuasive position.
- **Intensity (0.9)**: The emotional weight of comparing low wages to slavery adds high intensity to the expression of this view.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: The reference to specific wage levels and the author’s personal experience with labor provides concrete examples.

### Third Quarter:
- **Valence (0.6)**: The focus on periodic increases tied to inflation indicates a concern for economic stability and fairness, which is a positive aspect, but it maintains a somewhat neutral tone.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The proposal is less assertive and more analytical, making a suggestion rather than a forceful statement.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The emotional tone is moderate, focusing more on practicality than emotion in this section.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: The idea of linking to inflation provides an economic framework, which adds some level of concreteness.

### Fourth Quarter:
- **Valence (0.5)**: The mention of $15 as "too high" introduces a negative aspect, but does not provide much elaboration on this viewpoint, leading to a more neutral valence.
- **Dominance (0.4)**: The tone softens as it acknowledges that there are differing perspectives, reducing the dominance of the argument.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The language used is moderate, reflecting a rationale without strong emotional appeal.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: It references the belief about comfort in low-wage jobs, but lacks specific data or examples to back this up.

These scores reflect the tone, assertiveness, emotional engagement, and specificity found within each portion of the argument across four relevant dimensions.
