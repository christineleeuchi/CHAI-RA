Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument presented in the "CMV" submission along the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break down the analysis into four quarters of the argument. Here are the scores for each dimension on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:**
"CMV: There is no difference between believing you don't know how the universe came in to being, and believing that God brought the universe in to being The universe exists, and came in to being somehow."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral. The statement is more of a logical assertion rather than emotionally charged.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (It presents an argument but doesn't strongly assert dominance over opposing views.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; it raises a philosophical question but is not confrontational.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The concepts discussed are abstract but grounded in concrete ideas about the universe's existence.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:**
"Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and roughly *how* it did, but what caused it to come in to being is a unanswered question - one we may never answer."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, reflects uncertainty.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Acknowledges a stance but does not dominate the discourse.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Some intensity through the acknowledgment of unanswered questions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Better grounding with references to time and causation of the universe.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:**
"There are others that believe God brought the Universe in to being (that is, an all powerful entity was the first-mover, setting the universe in motion)."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, presenting belief without emotional weight.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This segment acknowledges a belief system but doesn't assert dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate; describes a belief but isn't polarizing.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Conceptually clearer as it hints at the nature of God and the action of creation.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:**
"But if God is all powerful and infinite, we have no idea what His/Her/its nature is, and couldn't possibly know, as mortal, finite beings. What is the difference between saying we don't know how the universe came in to being, and saying that this entity that we don't know the nature of, and couldn't possibly comprehend, brought the universe in to being? Aren't they equally nebulous beliefs?"

- **Valence:** 0.6 (A bit more critical of the concept of God; some implied skepticism.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Stronger argument; it challenges existing beliefs about the nature of God.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Higher intensity; questions the validity of belief in God as a creator.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Still abstract but discusses the inherent unknowability of God.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.4 | Intensity: 0.5 | Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.3 | Intensity: 0.4 | Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.4 | Intensity: 0.4 | Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.6 | Dominance: 0.6 | Intensity: 0.7 | Concreteness: 0.5

These ratings reflect an analysis of the premises and implications presented throughout the text, offering a balanced view of the argument's nuances.
