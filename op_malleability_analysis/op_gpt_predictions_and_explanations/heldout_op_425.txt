Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
Here is the rating for each of the categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument's text:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: Tom Brady is guilty. I've read the [20 page report released from Goodell.](https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/07282015-final-decision-tom-brady-appeal.pdf) I've read [Kraft's speech.](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/07/29/robert-kraft-tees-off-on/) I've read [Brady's Facebook post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3f0m1w/tom_bradys_statement_via_facebook/) The entire thing seems like a sloppy attempt at a coverup."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to negative tone, presents an accusation)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Assertive statement of guilt)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate, given the context but isn't overly emotional)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Mentions specific sources, but still general in terms of proof)

- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong assertion about Brady’s behavior)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Emotional language suggesting deceitfulness)
