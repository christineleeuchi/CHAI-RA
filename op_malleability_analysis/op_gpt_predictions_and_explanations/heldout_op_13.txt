Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To rate the argument provided in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will consider each quarter of the argument separately and assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the following definitions:

- **Valence**: The emotional value associated with the argument (positive or negative).
- **Dominance**: The level of control or authority expressed in the argument.
- **Intensity**: The strength of the emotions or opinions expressed.
- **Concreteness**: The clarity and specificity of the ideas presented.

Here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument:

**1st Quarter (Introduction and Main Thesis)**:
- Valence: 0.3 (Negative perception of user-friendliness)
- Dominance: 0.5 (Expresses an opinion, but not overly authoritative)
- Intensity: 0.6 (Strong opinion on the security problems and technical illiteracy)
- Concreteness: 0.5 (General statement with some specific reference to user issues)

**2nd Quarter (Usability vs. Choice)**:
- Valence: 0.4 (Negative view on the trend of easier usability)
- Dominance: 0.6 (Clear assertion about the removal of choice)
- Intensity: 0.7 (Stronger language used to emphasize the problem with usability)
- Concreteness: 0.6 (Includes a specific example of a task)

**3rd Quarter (Population Dynamics and Experience)**:
- Valence: 0.2 (Very negative, as it discusses the shrinking population of new users)
- Dominance: 0.7 (Strong authoritative stance on the absurdity of catering to the shrinking population)
- Intensity: 0.6 (Concerned tone regarding the issue of user simplification)

**4th Quarter (Abstraction and User Learning)**:
- Valence: 0.4 (Negative on the abstraction of functionalities)
- Dominance: 0.6 (Authoritative critique of the effect of hiding functionalities)
- Intensity: 0.8 (Very intense language expressing frustration about user expectations)
- Concreteness: 0.7 (Provides specific examples of abstraction and metaphors)

In summary, the ratings for each quarter are:
1st Quarter: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
2nd Quarter: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6
3rd Quarter: Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
