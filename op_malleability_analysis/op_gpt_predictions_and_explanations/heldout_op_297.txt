Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: Yes, I am likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide a rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will evaluate each quarter of the text separately. Here are the ratings:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:**
"CMV: women's breast are not sexual organs growing up in america i was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i came to conscious and started realizing that there is practically no way a woman's breast could be sexual organs."

1. **Valence:** 0.3 - The tone is somewhat negative due to the critique of societal standards and beliefs.
2. **Dominance:** 0.4 - The speaker is asserting their viewpoint but also acknowledges past conditioning.
3. **Intensity:** 0.5 - The argument is moderately intense, given the subject matterâ€”challenging cultural norms.
4. **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The argument is relatively concrete, referencing a personal journey of realization.

### Quarter 2:
**Text:**
"i mean obviously we men have breast too and our breast dont stimulate the opposite sex in any different way. and yes i'm well aware that during sex women could receive lots of stimulation through them in the act of foreplay. but so do other body parts, like the neck, the mouth, the foot, etc. lets also not forget that women do need their breast to breastfeed  their children, which this obviously screams out that they cant be sex organs."

1. **Valence:** 0.5 - The tone is neutral to somewhat positive, focusing on logical reasoning rather than emotion.
2. **Dominance:** 0.7 - The speaker confidently presents arguments to support their viewpoint.
3. **Intensity:** 0.4 - The intensity is moderate; it includes factual comparisons but lacks emotional weight.
4. **Concreteness:** 0.7 - The argument is concrete, providing clear examples to substantiate claims.

### Quarter 3:
**Text:**
"anyways it seems like the more i try to believe this the more negative reactions i get from those around me. people here still insist that women's breast are sexual organs and the fact that women here in america, unlike women in africa or other countries in europe are still too afraid to go topless outside when its too hot kinda punctuates this believe. we also must forget that or government does believe they are sexual breast as it is against the law either way for women to go topless out in the streets."

1. **Valence:** 0.2 - The tone is negative, expressing frustration with societal norms and reactions.
2. **Dominance:** 0.5 - The speaker presents a case but expresses a sense of being undermined by societal beliefs.
3. **Intensity:** 0.6 - The intensity increases with personal emotional experiences and societal observations.
4. **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The argument remains concrete, referencing social norms and laws.

### Quarter 4:
**Text:**
"I also like to point out that i was watching that documentary [Free The Nipple](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2298394/) the other day on Netflix and it really touched me. i think it really is unfair that during heatwave days a man can take his shirt off in public yet women can't. i think we americans are too damn dramatic going judgmentally ballistic when we see boobs in public. at the same do to how we americans have been sexually conditioned since day one i'm actually amazed that there are women here who complain about not being able to go topless out in public. i thought that would of been the worst and most humiliating nightmare for an American woman."

1. **Valence:** 0.3 - The tone remains somewhat negative as it critiques societal hypocrisy.
2. **Dominance:** 0.6 - The speaker asserts their opinion but still acknowledges a broader societal context.
