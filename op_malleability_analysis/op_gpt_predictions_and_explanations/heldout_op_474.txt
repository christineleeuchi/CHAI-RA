Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument on the specified dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break down the assessment into quarters of the text. Each category will be rated from 0.0 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest).

**1st Quarter:**
*“CMV: Government officials have very little control over economic growth and political candidates are either bluffing or stupid when they say they will "grow the economy."”*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is quite critical of politicians and government officials, suggesting skepticism.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion, positioning politicians as either liars or fools, establishing authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There’s a moderate level of assertiveness but could be stronger in its argumentative tone.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Makes clear statements but lacks detailed examples at this stage.)

**2nd Quarter:**
*“There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians.”*

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly critical; highlights a lack of consensus without strong negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument is exploratory, weighing different perspectives rather than dominating the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Less intense; more of an analytical view presented.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Offers specific examples of economic strategies, improving the clarity of the argument.)

**3rd Quarter:**
*“Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low.”*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is somewhat pessimistic, emphasizing limitations on government action.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument remains reasoned, offering counterpoints to previous claims without an overbearing tone.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The rationale is clear but without passionate language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Uses specific economic terms and situations to substantiate points.)

**4th Quarter:**
*“New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements. Investor confidence helps, a little, maybe, sometimes, but the U.S. stock market is already overpriced. Beyond that, most economic growth comes from increases in productivity, and consumer confidence. Elected officials have no control over these.”*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The overall tone remains critical, suggesting that existing measures are insufficient; somewhat negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker continues to assert control over the narrative by dismissing government effectiveness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Shows a stronger belief in the argument's validity and is more definitive in its conclusions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Provides clear insights into specific factors affecting economic growth, making the argument robust.)

**Summary of Ratings:**
1st Quarter: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5  
2nd Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.6   
3rd Quarter: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7  
4th Quarter: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.8  

These ratings reflect the varying characteristics throughout the argument, showcasing how the value and strength of the claims evolve.
