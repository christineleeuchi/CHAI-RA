Sure! Here’s a rating from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of each quarter of the argument:

### First Quarter:
**Text**: "CMV: The US government owes reparations to descendants of slaves. I acknowledge straight away that sending checks to black people will not solve all modern the issues caused by the slave economy."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The argument expresses a moral obligation which has a positive connotation, but it also acknowledges the limitations of financial reparations, introducing some negativity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker is assertive in their claim but also recognizes the complexity and nuances of the issue.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The argument is moderate in intensity, with a balanced tone rather than extreme emotions or urgency.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The speaker makes a specific claim about reparations, but the acknowledgment of limitations adds a level of abstraction.)

### Second Quarter:
**Text**: "With that said, I do believe that the government owes the reparation. The fact of the matter is that slaves generated wealth for their owners. This wealth translates into capital that is still present in our economy."

- **Valence**: 0.8 (The statement is positive in asserting the moral obligation, making a strong claim about the justice of reparations.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker takes a strong position, indicating a clear point of view on the matter.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The use of definitive language (“the government owes”) conveys a moderate level of passion about the topic.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The argument presents specific economic claims about wealth generation and historical context.)

### Third Quarter:
**Text**: "A good amount of this capital went to the federal government. The government taxed some of the capital generated by slaves for owners."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (This part is more factual and thus less emotionally charged, balancing the previous intensity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker maintains an authoritative stance by providing evidence for their argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The argument is factual, which gives it moderate intensity but lacks emotional appeals.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The claim refers to specific historical and financial transactions, making the argument concrete and relatable.)

### Fourth Quarter:
**Text**: "Some other capital was produced directly for the government. Slaves built the Capitol building. Slaves built the Treasury, and their capital rests in the Treasury. So we can think of reparations as back pay. The recipients are not here to accept it, so their most direct heirs are entitled to it."

- **Valence**: 0.9 (This part has a very positive connotation by linking reparations to justice and back pay.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The speaker is quite assertive, providing clear conclusions and connecting historical facts to current obligations.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There is a heightened intensity in the argument, particularly in the strong language regarding the rights of heirs.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (The argument is very concrete, with specific examples of contributions from slaves to government buildings.)

Overall, the argument presents a compelling case for reparations, structured with a blend of emotional appeals and concrete historical support.
