Expected yes, likely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To provide scores for your specified dimensions, I'll break down the argument into four quarters and evaluate each based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1
- **Text**: "CMV: Edward Snowden failed to gain support from the left because he attacked a democratic president and his administration. If Edward Snowden had revealed NSA secrets during a republican administration, he would have received more support from left-leaning politicians and from liberals and democrats."
  
1. **Valence**: 0.6 (Moderately negative towards the left for not supporting Snowden)
2. **Dominance**: 0.5 (Neutral; presents an argument without strong authoritative claims)
3. **Intensity**: 0.5 (Mildly strong stance but primarily speculative)
4. **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Some concrete points made but largely hypothetical)

### Quarter 2
- **Text**: "Because he presented as a libertarian, and was perceived to have attacked the Obama administration, democrats and liberals were not receptive to his disclosures."
  
1. **Valence**: 0.7 (Negative towards Democrats for not being receptive)
2. **Dominance**: 0.6 (Stronger claim about perceptions impacting support)
3. **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderately strong due to its definitive language)
4. **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Cites specific groups' reactions; more concrete than the first part)

### Quarter 3
- **Text**: "Republicans generally tend to be supportive of a strong military defense, and so the NSA's actions naturally align with republican leanings."
  
1. **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; simply stating a characteristic of a political group)
2. **Dominance**: 0.4 (Less authoritative; it’s descriptive rather than prescriptive)
3. **Intensity**: 0.4 (Low intensity; straightforward observation)
4. **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Concrete in terms of political ideology)

### Quarter 4
- **Text**: "So, he received no support from the republicans or democrats, and this has played a part in how his message has been framed in the media, and what our political representatives say about him."
  
1. **Valence**: 0.5 (Moderately neutral; outlines a situation without overt negativity)
2. **Dominance**: 0.5 (Balanced claim on both parties’ lack of support)
3. **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity; summarizes the argument's conclusion)
4. **Concreteness**: 0.6 (More concrete as it ties political dynamics to media framing)

These scores provide a nuanced picture of how the argument's tone and impact might be perceived across its different sections.
