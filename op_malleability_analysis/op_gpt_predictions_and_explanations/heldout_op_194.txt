Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To analyze the argument, I'll break it down into four quarters and provide the requested scores for each.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "CMV: When minorities complain about cultural appropriation it in itself perpetuates racism and self segregation."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The argument presents a critical view of minority complaints, which may evoke negative feelings.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion, suggesting their stance over others.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a strong assertion about racism and self-segregation.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The concepts presented are somewhat abstract—racism and self-segregation need context for clarity.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "I see black friends complaining about cultural appropriation lately, my issue is the hypocrisy of it all. They say that we shouldn't be taking their culture and traditions while happily appropriating other cultures into their own."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The argument contains critique, but also reflects personal observation.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (There is a definitive claim of hypocrisy, indicating an authoritative stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate heat in describing the hypocrisy of the situation.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The notion of hypocrisy is specific but relies on individual examples which are general in nature.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "It's the 'us' against the world mentality that is very hurtful to minorities. One of the most common arguments I hear is in music. They say people like Iggy Azalea shouldn't be around making hip hop and rap and wearing her hair a certain way because of the color of her skin? Because she didn't earn it?"

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The view expresses concern over hurtful mentalities but critiques simultaneously.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker expresses a view on perceived exclusion but doesn't seek to dominate the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There's a strong emotional charge regarding the 'us' vs. 'them' mentality.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Mentions specific examples, adding some tangible instances to the abstract accusations.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "Isn't that backwards thinking? While Beyonce and Alicia Keys sometimes dawn white girl hair. Cultural appropriation is a good thing because it leads to different people experiencing other traditions and cultures."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Challenges the thinking of others, which could evoke mixed reactions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The phrase 'Isn't that backwards thinking?' asserts the speaker's opinion strongly.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There’s a moderately strong assertion about cultural appropriation being positive.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Addresses specific examples like Beyoncé and Alicia Keys, making the argument more tangible.)
