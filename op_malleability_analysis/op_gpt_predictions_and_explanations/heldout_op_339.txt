Expected no, unlikely to change mind. GPT responded: No, I am not likely to change my mindset if presented with strong counterarguments.
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of these dimensions, dividing the argument into four quarters. 

**Quarter 1: "CMV: Bernie Sanders idea of free college doesn't seem like a good thing. This is probably because I am really bad at understanding politics and don't totally know what Sanders wants to do."**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral tone; expresses skepticism towards a political idea but acknowledges personal confusion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.2 (Humble admission of lack of knowledge leads to a less dominant position.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Emotions are present but subdued; the speaker seems uncertain.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument introduces a specific political idea but lacks concrete details about the proposal.)

**Quarter 2: "But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct? Does that mean that taxes would get raised or that he would just alter around the spending the government does? Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free? That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that. Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative sentiment regarding taxes and fairness; perceives an unfair burden.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Presents a strong perspective regarding personal financial implications.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Raising taxes creates a strong emotional reaction about fairness and personal financial strain.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific concerns about taxes and student loans make the argument more grounded.)

**Quarter 3: "And what happens with private institutions? Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it? Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Expresses concern and dissatisfaction; perceived unfairness towards subsidizing private education.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Questions the implications of the proposal, showing engagement and pushback.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong emotional response regarding fairness and personal experience.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Addresses specific concerns about private education and personal hardships.)

**Quarter 4: "I mean, on paper his idea sounds great. Free college, a better educated America, a more economically even country. YAY. But that doesn't come for free. And just because I am finally out of school and making a semi-decent wage doesn't mean I should have to pay for other people. I guess that means I am anti-socialism? Is there maybe any other way that this could be accomplished? Like just lessening the cost of college somehow instead of totally free?"**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Acknowledges potential positives but ultimately presents a negative view on the concept.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Asserts a personal stance and raises questions about alternative solutions.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; expresses frustration but also seeks alternatives.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Offers specific alternatives and reflections on the concept of fairness and socialism.)

These scores reflect the way the argument is structured and the sentiments expressed in each quarter.
