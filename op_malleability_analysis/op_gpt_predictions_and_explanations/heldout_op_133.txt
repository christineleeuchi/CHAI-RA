To assess the argument in each quarter (or section) based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here are the ratings:

### Quarter 1:
> **Argument Excerpt:** "CMV: The middle class is shrinking because our definition of 'middle class' keeps inflating..."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument presents a somewhat negative view of the current state of the middle class but acknowledges that wealth distribution and income inequality are real issues.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The author suggests a clear opinion about the definition of the middle class and its implications.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; while the assertion is strong, it's presented in a somewhat measured tone.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The argument begins with abstract concepts regarding definitions, lacking specific examples at this stage.)

### Quarter 2:
> **Argument Excerpt:** "...Middle class families used to live in 2-4 bedroom 1-2 bath bungalows..."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Reflects a nostalgic view of the past, suggesting that the current situation is lacking in comparison.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The conversational tone provides a relatable perspective but does not strongly push toward an authoritative stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Higher intensity through specific examples of past living conditions and lifestyle choices.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This section is very concrete, filled with detailed descriptions that paint a picture of the past middle-class lifestyle.)

### Quarter 3:
> **Argument Excerpt:** "Now, 'middle class' people are shopping for luxury/designer brand clothing..."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Similar to the previous section, this reflects negatively on current middle-class standards and consumer behavior.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author expresses a clear sense of judgment about current behaviors compared to the past.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (This section delivers a stronger critique of present-day middle-class lifestyles, with specific contrasts to the past.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Emphasizes concrete examples of consumption and lifestyle choices, grounding the argument in visible distinctions.)

### Quarter 4:
> **Argument Excerpt:** "Yes, many of those things are cheaper than they once were..."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (A more neutral approach as it acknowledges cheaper options, but it also calls for reevaluation of definitions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument pushes for a reevaluation of what middle class means, maintaining a clear stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Maintains moderate intensity as it reiterates the need for societal change in perspective.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (This section is somewhat abstract as it discusses the need for reevaluation without additional specific examples.)

### Summary Ratings:

- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8
