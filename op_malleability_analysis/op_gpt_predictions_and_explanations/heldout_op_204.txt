**Intensity:** 0.6 - There's a strong emotional appeal regarding the seriousness of climate change and its consequences.

**Dominance:** 0.6 - The argument is more assertive as it critiques those who deny climate change and points to the required frequency of disasters.

**Concreteness:** 0.6 - Uses specific examples (Hurricane Sandy) to illustrate points, making it more tangible.
