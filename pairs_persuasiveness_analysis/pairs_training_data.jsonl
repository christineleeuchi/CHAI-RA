I need flavour. Salf, pepper, stock or gravy, oil to cook the meat, maybe some dried herbs if we want to actually like it. Yes these things will last forever and I can use them in anything, but i need to have enough money at one point to buy these over actual food. \n\nAnd I have to have a pot large enough to cook it in.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"The theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy. Basically, the idea is that if a company has more money, it'll hire more people, which reduces unemployment and boosts the economy. \n\nMy logic thusfar: first, as far as I'm aware, there is no evidence that this tactic has ever worked.\n\nWith that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like Walmart, McDonald's, etc. For some reason, I doubt that a company like Walmart with a $40 billion net profit needs more money to hire people. Most of the tax revenue the federal government would lose in a tax cut would be going to companies like this that don't actually need it. And we, as taxpayers, would either have to pay for the difference through our own taxes, or take cuts to other services.\n\nBut let's look at the other companies that would be saving money through tax cuts; the ones that supposedly would benefit and hire more people. Let's say the economy is stagnant (i.e. neither growing nor shrinking), and demand is flat for those companies. They have enough employees and resources to meet demand. Now, give them some money to hire more people. What are their choices for that money? Well, supposedly they can hire a few people, and those few people getting an income will help create demand for products. The problem is, those people aren't going to turn around and spend their entire paycheck on products produced by just that company, so the company is going to get back less than they invested in their workers.\n\nNow, supposedly tax cuts across multiple companies will create widespread demand, but as a company, what is the better business decision: wait for demand to increase, then hire people to meet it; or hire people, and risk not having demand rise to meet your now excess production (or maybe risk having your excess production become obsolete before it can be sold)? Obviously, the better business decision is the first. Unlike the second, it is no risk and guarantees the company saves money, and if every company makes that same decision, then no one will ever get hired, defeating the theory that corporate tax cuts will create jobs.\n\nWhat's more, if demand is outstripping production, then, assuming the company is actually functioning like any company should, it should be turning a profit, which would allow it to hire more people anyway. And if demand is so great that they can't hire enough people to meet it, then they can just resort to other sources of funding, like loans, to expand production. This has worked for countless companies in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nIn the third situation, where demand is dropping, the company is more likely going to be trimming it's workforce, not wanting to hire more people.\n\nThere is a reason why there is no evidence that giving money to corporations  works. It doesn't directly create demand, and the smart business decision is to wait for demand to increase before investing in increased production. And even then, as a profitable business, it should have the resources necessary to do so anyway.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing things, but what?

Basically, the idea is that if a company has more money, it'll hire more people, which reduces unemployment and boosts the economy. \n\nMy logic thusfar: first, as far as I'm aware, there is no evidence that this tactic has ever worked.\n\nWith that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like Walmart, McDonald's, etc. For some reason, I doubt that a company like Walmart with a $40 billion net profit needs more money to hire people. Most of the tax revenue the federal government would lose in a tax cut would be going to companies like this that don't actually need it. And we, as taxpayers, would either have to pay for the difference through our own taxes, or take cuts to other services.\n\nBut let's look at the other companies that would be saving money through tax cuts; the ones that supposedly would benefit and hire more people. Let's say the economy is stagnant (i.e. neither growing nor shrinking), and demand is flat for those companies. They have enough employees and resources to meet demand. Now, give them some money to hire more people. What are their choices for that money? Well, supposedly they can hire a few people, and those few people getting an income will help create demand for products. The problem is, those people aren't going to turn around and spend their entire paycheck on products produced by just that company, so the company is going to get back less than they invested in their workers.\n\nNow, supposedly tax cuts across multiple companies will create widespread demand, but as a company, what is the better business decision: wait for demand to increase, then hire people to meet it; or hire people, and risk not having demand rise to meet your now excess production (or maybe risk having your excess production become obsolete before it can be sold)? Obviously, the better business decision is the first. Unlike the second, it is no risk and guarantees the company saves money, and if every company makes that same decision, then no one will ever get hired, defeating the theory that corporate tax cuts will create jobs.\n\nWhat's more, if demand is outstripping production, then, assuming the company is actually functioning like any company should, it should be turning a profit, which would allow it to hire more people anyway. And if demand is so great that they can't hire enough people to meet it, then they can just resort to other sources of funding, like loans, to expand production. This has worked for countless companies in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nIn the third situation, where demand is dropping, the company is more likely going to be trimming it's workforce, not wanting to hire more people.\n\nThere is a reason why there is no evidence that giving money to corporations  works. It doesn't directly create demand, and the smart business decision is to wait for demand to increase before investing in increased production. And even then, as a profitable business, it should have the resources necessary to do so anyway.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing things, but what? And are they actually enough to offset the flaws I'm currently thinking about?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The implicit assumption is that the test for to hire or not to hire is if the company is profitable. That is not the test. This would be to assume that the goal of a company is to maximize employment. If that were the case then every company would hire until they were no longer profitable, and there would be no long term profitable companies. \n\nFurther:\n\n~~Rather than maximizing employment, the goal of a company is (generally) to maximize profit. So the test for whether or not to hire another person is whether a new hire will generate (more) profit. Will the new hire generate more value for the company than his salary? If yes: hire; If no: don't. One key part there is 'for the company'. Taxes don't change how productive the new hire's labor is, but they may effect how much of his productivity the company gets to keep.~~\n\n~~Consider new hire before tax cut:~~\n\n~~Salary: 60,000~~\n\n~~Productivity: 65,000~~\n\n~~Tax liability: 7,000~~\n\n~~Company net: -2,000~~\n\n~~Recommendation: DO NOT HIRE~~\n\n~~A change in the tax liability can change the 'company net' to a positive and switch the recommendation to a DO HIRE.

I will also acknowledge that I am by no means a medical professional and am probably less educated on the subject than many of you. So, those things are granted, no need to point them out. Now, as for my argument: I simply don't believe that vaccines are safe for everyone to use. Let me share a story with you:\n\nIn the summer before my junior year of high school, I was sitting in my basement playing video games one day when I felt a stroke of dizziness. I immediately turned the game off and went to get some water, only to find that I couldn't make it up the stairs. I fell over, head spinning, and called to my parents for help. They got me upstairs, at which point I threw up until there was nothing left in my stomach. I couldn't open my eyes without the world whirling by at an uncontrollable speed, so I kept my eyes closed while they took me to the emergency room.\n\nWhat I'm describing is something many of you may have experienced: vertigo. If I'm being honest, writing that made me a little anxious. For some time afterward, I would be anxious any time I got dizzy for any reason out of fear that I was lapsing back into vertigo. Anyway, I got to see a doctor and underwent numerous tests including an MRI (note: I think the test had a different name, but I can't remember exactly what it was and I know that it bore heavy resemblance to an MRI. Just think of it as a head scan). They couldn't tell what the cause was, but they suspected that (you know where I'm going with this) the vertigo was caused by the vaccine I had received before getting vertigo. The vaccine was for HPV, which I guess is a fairly recent development for males. \n\nWhatever protection was offered by that vaccine was simply not worth it. I lived with vertigo for a month, unable to stand up for long periods of time, or really do much besides lay in bed and try to comfort my stomach to the point where I could hydrate myself. I do not wish that upon anyone. That's why I'm against mandatory vaccinations for all, and why I disagree with people who tout the efficacy of vaccines as 100% fact. For that to be the top comment on an AskReddit thread is plainly ridiculous. \n\nJust a couple more things to consider: (1) every time I went in to see the doctor for subsequent check-ups, a nurse or a doctor would tell me that I still needed to take the second installment of the Gardasil HPV vaccine. I would tell them what happened, and they would instantly agree that I should stay away from the vaccine - a far more rational approach than many redditors seem to take, no? Just throwing it out there - I have been told by legitimate medical professionals not to take that vaccine. \n\n(2) I am *not* against vaccination. A couple years after the vertigo, I willingly received the vaccine for meningitis. But I did research the crap out of it beforehand. I will consider future vaccines in the same way - with open-mindedness and a healthy dose of skepticism.\n\n(3) I am *not* the only one who has suffered serious issues at the hands of this vaccine. I wrote a comment about this earlier, so I'm just going to reuse a link: [Here's](http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/stress-and-health-dr-lind/2013/apr/10/us-court-pays-6-million-gardasil-victims/) an article about it. Even some simple Googling will probably clue you in to the damage this vaccine has caused.

Do you know what *really* sucks? Cervical cancer.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at this not from the personal perspective, that's not where vaccines matter, but from a population perspective. If a vaccine has a net benefit for a society it should be presented as a positive option. So in this line of thinking if a vaccine were to have *awful* side effects, say severe issues with 5% of those who receive it, but it *saves* more individuals from the same or more severe side effects it is beneficial at a population scale. Aka, 5% will suffer with the vaccine but 10% will suffer if it is not provided so it should be provided.\n\nIt sucks for that 5%, they are worse off, but it's worse for those who don't get the protection that the vaccine would have granted.\n\nNow, the HPV vaccine. 1 in 10,000 will have side effects greater than minor, airway constrictions being the notable effects (source)[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/hpv-vaccine-cervarix-gardasil-side-effects.aspx]. What you experienced was a *very* rare side effect that I can't seem to find sources as far as this occurring in general cases. In general there haven't been large numbers of severe side effects justifying not vaccinating.\n\nOn to your article. It is shit. Sorry, but it is. There have been 200 cases. 200! If you are wondering why I point that out it is because it is incredibly low considered the number of individuals vaccinated. It states that the \"National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has awarded $5,877,710 dollars to 49 victims in claims made against the highly controversial HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccines.\" but it doesn't specify what *for*. Until that context is provided this statement means nothing.\n\n\"The adverse reaction reports detail 26 new deaths reported between September 1, 2010 and September 15, 2011 as well as incidents of seizures, paralysis, blindness, pancreatitis, speech problems, short term memory loss and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. The documents come from the FDA\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which is used by the FDA to monitor the safety of vaccines.\"\n\nFirst, they don't provide the source so bells start going off. Second, 26 deaths is extremely low compared to the tens of thousands of individuals who would suffer and possibly die from cervical cancer. If this is true then the vaccine doesn't appear that bad.\n\n\"In response to the concern about death reports among those who received Gardasil, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) insists  \u201cthere was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine.\u201d \"\n\nSoooooo what's the problem? If the CDC, a group unassociated with Gardasil, states that there isn't statistical evidence that there is a link. So why should I care?\n\n\"In fact, Merck studied the Gardasil vaccine in fewer than 1,200 girls under 16 prior to it being released to the market under a fast-tracked road to licensure.\"\n\nwhich is normal. It's called a sample rather than a census and is done in most clinical trials. You wouldn't reject a chemotherapeutic drug because it was only tested on 1200 individuals if it was proven that it worked.\n\n\"Neurologist Dr. Ian Sutton reported negative neurological side effects from Gardasil. He reported five cases of multiple sclerosis-like symptoms emerging shortly after women received the Gardasil vaccine, noting:\n\n\u201cWe report five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelinating syndromes within 21 days of immunization with the quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil. Although the target population for vaccination, young females, has an inherently high risk for MS, the temporal association with demyelinating events in these cases may be explained by the potent immuno-stimulatory properties of HPV virus-like particles which comprise the vaccine.\u201d\n\nWithout a linked to a paper that actually shows that there is statistical significance. This statement means *absolutely nothing* as far as scientific evidence is concerned. It is an observation of possible correlation. If he wanted to prove this he can set up a study and see if there is actually anything going on. If he doesn't do so then he can shut the fuck up (excuse my language but seriously, he presented **5** cases of something that he suspects might be in correlation with the vaccine but nothing more).\n\n&gt;HPV vaccines have been illegally administered to millions without informed consent, as the risks rarely disclosed.\n\nA bold statement He needs to back up this *very* strong statement or I will consider him a liar.\n\nBasically, if you had posted this on your own I would have asked for your source about 10 times and then informed you that observing a couple cases doesn't mean anything of statistical importance.\n\nAs for the author, he specialized in metabolism and diet with zero research publications that I can find.

The only other reason why is if they are allergic to eggs, which are used to produce vaccines. There are almost no other good reasons why a vaccine should not be administered. \n\nPeople have always been afraid of vaccines, but in the past they were more afraid of the disease itself then they were of the vaccine. When polio was a threat, almost every family knew someone who had it. Nowadays, vaccines have been so effective that people are more afraid of a vaccine's potential side effect than of the actual disease. This is silly for two reasons:\n\n1. There are minimal side effects of vaccines. If there are any, they are almost always minor and short term.\n\n2. The actual disease is always more dangerous than the side effects, otherwise doctors wouldn't administer them. A sore arm is nothing next to becoming paralyzed due to polio.\n\nEvery single vaccine has been rigorously tested by many different organizations including the doctors and scientists who develop them, the pharmaceutical companies which sell them, the Food and Drug Administration, which approves them, and the Center for Disease Control, which continually checks on them. These are just a few of the organizations who check on vaccines, and there are hundreds more both in the US and abroad. Yes it's possible that every single person who has ever studied the vaccine has missed a side effect, but it is incredibly unlikely.\n\nIt is frustrating that even though vaccines are highly effective, very inexpensive, have minimal side effects, have been rigorously tested, and have saved billions of lives, people who don't understand even the basics of medicine will refuse them because they are afraid.\n\nFor example, people are afraid of autism, but instead of trying to find the root cause, they simply blame vaccines, despite the fact that the only person why has ever suggested that they were responsible was proven to be a liar and a fraud.\n\nIt's possible that the HPV vaccine has some deadly side effects that we don't understand yet, but right there is no scientific evidence that it does. What we do know is that for the minute risk of fainting spells, we can prevent the spread of a virus that causes genital warts and cancer, and which 79 million Americans already have, and 14 million new Americans get every year.\n\nI would say that vaccines are absolutely worth the cost benefit ratio for almost every single person on earth, even if the side effects were much worse than the tiny ones that exist now.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

Because if you don't think that happens, I can tell you it does. \n\nSo, there is where I think that rather than placing the expectation solely on the guy, *both* sexes needed to be better educated. We could just as easily say women should be expected to not have sex with a guy they don't want to risk having a child with. Would it change anything? No, not at all, because it's irrational. If instead we stopped trying to place blame on one or the other sex and focus on teaching, advocating and displaying personal responsibility *to both sexes* in all matters sexual, then we would see a dramatic improvement over time. \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

That option is still there for so many people. Birth control applies to both genders.

Nor should a woman. But as we as humans have discovered, sex doesn't have to be exclusive to procreation, and neither men nor women should be trapped in situations that were not planned on based on consequences that could have been remedied before the real problems occur, like paying financial support or keeping and raising a child when abortion and adoption are completely reasonable.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

They didn't attack strategic targets, they tried to terrorize the US into meeting their demands.  The same is true of, say, the IRA bombings in London, the Boston Marathon bombing, and pretty much any suicide bomber who goes into civilian areas with the intent of killing as many people as possible.\n\n&gt; But have you ever really questioned what it takes to be considered a terrorist?

Do you need to blow up buildings, kill innocent people, think a certain way, and be apart of a radical or religious group?\n\nWell, yeah, you need to target non-strategic targets in a way to incite mayhem and fear to accomplish a political goal.  So, if you are just insane and think it's fun to kill people, you aren't a terrorist, just a murderer without a political agenda.  If you try to blow up a military base, you aren't a terrorist, you're a guerrilla fighter..  \n\n&gt;Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? \n\nNo.  The Oklahoma City bombers were terrorists.

One is good, one is not so good.\n\n1. We should stop *overusing* the word terrorist as a scare word and take a deeper look at political relations. I agree with this entirely. The amount of people who die from terrorist attacks outside specific unstable war-zones is pretty limited and it is a danger like any other but not one to give up your rights and cry over. Terrorism is also inherently political. If your country is suffering a lot of terrorist attacks it is indicative of terrible relations with another country or ethnic group.\n\n2. The second part seems to be an argument that terrorism isn't a real thing. The term is usually described as an indiscriminate attack on a population intending to cause fear and chaos for political gain. In that way they are different then lets say a rebel force who fights an enemy government. Someone who stages an attack and occupies an enemy military base is a rebel. Someone who bombs a bus full of children going to school is a terrorist. The difference here is not what side your on, it is your target. I'd also say that while someone like Anders Breivik, who killed for political reasons, is a terrorist, a kid who decides to go to school and start blowing peoples' heads off with a shotgun one morning is usually not a terrorist. They are a mass murderer and possibly have mental issues yes, but they are not furthering a strategic ideological goal.

Either that, or there is an extreme amount of naivet\u00e9 at work here.\n\nThis isn't isolated to just nudity or partial nudity, either. It has become a trope in Western society that when attractive people, perhaps most often women, wear provocative clothing out in public, they get \"harassed\" by people giving them compliments or simply looking a bit too long. These people get **angry** at being looked at or complimented on their appearance. Our world is sexual. It is the way nature works. Sexual attraction is normal and good.\n\nI believe that these people who claim to be surprised, offended, or emotionally traumatized by open displays of sexual attraction either need a reality check or need to grow up. I do not believe that these displays are harmful.\n\nCMV.\n\n**EDIT: Alright everyone, I've had my opinion altered a good bit. I still hold that these people in this protest knew what they were getting into, but the discussion on objectification was fantastic. I've learned that my definition of \"objectification\" was at best very loose and at worse downright incorrect. I wasn't aware of behaviors like self-objectification or body-monitoring, and several of the studies and videos linked were very elucidating. Thanks everyone for your contributions to changing my view. I probably won't be replying to this thread any more. Have a good one, everyone. \u2206**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The U.S. military is spread out all over the globe, so even if there is a million volunteers, are they really going to bring them *all* back to fight against the citizenry they swore to protect? They would only step in as a tertiary force to finish what the secondary layer of order couldn't handle. \n\n--That leaves the police and the National Guard to restore order and maintain the order that preceded the revolution, which would act as a secondary layer of resistance to a nationwide insurgency.\n\n--The primary layer of order is ideological, and can be used as a tool to divide the citizenry in a way that makes them fight against one another. The \"right\" would no doubt maintain a certain ideological distance from the \"left,\" likely siding with the military apparatuses that come after so long as the message the federal government maintains is one of order and nationalism. \n\nAs it stands, the federal government is headed by a black moderate (who, I contend is actually pretty right leaning, but the radical right, the ones more likely to engage in such a conflict, consider him a socialist), but if that were to change, it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to basically characterize the \"liberals\" as a deficient aberration of the American ideal. The same is true if it were to happen now, the \"left,\" likely would sit back and watch a burgeoning revolution turn to an insurgency by the far right, and support the military apparatus as it crushes them.  \n\nThis would essentially change what you are saying from a whole sale revolution into an internal conflict between warring ideological factions refereed by the secondary and tertiary pyramid of military control. It's unlikely that there is a single thing that could happen in this country that would operate as an ideological bridge between the increasingly disparate political ideologies at work in the U.S. You'll likely never see white racists from any part of the country recognize their sameness with anyone of color. Religious extremists would never embrace those with alternative lifestyles. The uneducated will likely never trust the educated, and vice versa, etc. \n\nBut if something ever did happen that suddenly tied all of those groups together. If it was discovered that aliens actually usurped the bodies of the government and key leaders in the military, and they meant us harm, it would be different. I say something this outlandish because conflict is predicated wholly on dehumanizing the enemy, and since our country lives in a sort of stasis as a result of our deep divisions, it would require something wholly new and different to bridge that. A revolutionary army would have to see the government as something wholly different than itself, which, it is not. The government, for all it's idiocy, is still composed of voices that represent various sectors of the population. So, barring an alien take-over, you'd never be able to say that \"The Government\" *wholly* belongs to someone (or something) else. But if *somehow* those divisions were suddenly erased against a common foe:\n\n1.) Military is an industry, plain and simple, and only works as long as there is a product to be delivered (war), and is contingent on an entire economic thrust by the civilian population it represents. Without the civilian population manning the armories all over the U.S., the military would start running out of supplies. Additionally, if there was a sudden uprising, many of those armories would likely be taken over first, by the civilians who keep them operating. \n\n2.) A revelation strong enough to erase ideological lines in the United States would be enough to break the programming of any soldier base, particularly if they are told to go back to the neighborhoods they came from and attack their friends and families. If their friends and families have a reason to stand together in arms, so would they. \n\n3.) The biggest obstacle to such an uprising would be communication. The military would maintain the ability to communicate via satellite,etc. but that would be one of the first things the civilians would lose. It would make sense, from this perspective, to have already installed internet \"kill switches,\" \"back door\" programs that monitor and interpret communications, or directly attack the infrastructure of the internet. Of course, this would happen in stages just like the physical assault, with the attack on the infrastructure being a final solution if the monitoring didn't maintain it's effectiveness. However, if something was threatening enough to incite an armed revolution in the U.S., the people who man even the N.S.A. would likely switch sides as well for the same reason that the soldiers would. \n\nTL;DR The numbers on each side change significantly when you really consider what it would take to create the conditions for revolution. The ideological divisions in the U.S. would make revolution impossible right now, but if Aliens started pulling the strings of our leaders and that became widely known (which is an insanely idiotic proposition), I give the government about six months before it's wholly demolished. \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

Let's just get out of here already.\"\n\nI swear, sometimes it's like dealing with a child.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMy name is Jack Thornton. I'm a 17-year-old living in Lima, OH. My state's always been fairly quiet; back in 2008 and 2012, we got bombarded with political ads for the presidential races, but outside of election season it was always fairly quiet. I had 2 younger brothers, and a single mom. Dad passed away from cancer when I was 5. Sad story, yadda yadda. Doesn't matter, now I'm alone. All I have left is my friend Alex. But I guess you're wondering how I got here, inside this sewer system carrying an AR-15 and a few IEDs, and looking like I haven't showered in a month.\n\nWell, it's actually been 3 months since I showered, but I'll tell you the story anyways.\n\nBack in 2017, after the re-election of Hilary Clinton, right when we thought everything was safe, the country went to shit. There was a bombing campaign, a huge one, they told us, in D.C. Some 25 bombs placed around the capital, pretty strong explosives, in popular tourist centers. Security was worth fuck-all. Our President was killed, and so was half her Cabinet. We've got the 25th Amendment to handle shit like that, but apparently, that wasn't good enough.\n\nD.C erupted. There was a complete loss of control as people, fearing for their lives or their houses or whatever the hell they feared for, went out and rioted. They couldn't believe that they were hit, and who would blame them. They'd just lost families, friends...it's said the death toll was in the tens of thousands. But that's not where it started. See, the 25th Amendment was just a bunch of words on a peace of paper, and there were *riots* in the streets. So the military took over.\n\nWithout a President in charge, and thanks to the succession still being figured out and implemented, the military decided that riot control was necessary. Troops came out from their bases to restore order, which sounded great on paper. But it turned out a *lot* worse than they thought. It wasn't long before someone was killed by mistake, and then it got even worse.\n\nWe thought we were immune from things like the Arab Spring uprisings. Turns out we were just a lot slower to act. It was only a few months of attempts to implement martial law before the military began calling its own home from overseas to quell other uprisings. Texas was the first to rise up, which anyone could've guessed I suppose, and the situation just spiraled out of control.\n\nThe military, once it saw where this all was headed, took measures to protect itself. It didn't want to suffer the kind of executions and trials that typically follow revolutions, so it began to solidify itself. Soldiers were trained with orders to kill the \"rebels\" and the \"rioters\" to save the \"common person\"...never mind that we *are* the common people. The military rolled into many population centers, taking control where they could and implementing martial law, and killing indiscriminately where they couldn't.\n\nThe people fought back, as they were bound to. But it turned into more of an insurgency, since...well, fighting a tank isn't really that easy when all you've got is a 9 mm Beretta and a .22 AR-15. Ironic that after Afghanistan and Iraq, it'd be *us* fighting the same way the \"terrorists\" did. Guess we just never understood...\n\nOh, you want *my* story? Should've asked. Guess it can pick up somewhere around here.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the military consolidated, they first consolidated their own supplies. Many thought that the military couldn't function without funding, and that requires taxes. So they kept it flowing in a way...they rolled into big agricultural areas, took hostages among the families of the biggest growers, and kept them contingent on the continued cooperation of the agriculture.\n\nThey commandeered the railroads, and many of the refineries for oil along with coal supplies. That was all it took.\n\nWell, and the military supplies.\n\nSee, I live in Lima, OH, like I said. Lima is where they make tanks. And that means they want to keep those tanks rolling out. So one of the first places the military occupied when they realized this wasn't going to stop as easily as they'd hoped was here; they need tanks to protect themselves from our small arms. With the President out of the picture, and \"elections\" only slated for a few years from now, the \"interim government\" (puppets, if we call them what they are) have sent the military to keep itself supplied. My story starts on Day 24 of the official \"uprising\".\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHonestly, I was about to continue this story, but realized I'd just end up writing a book, and revamping all of the above to fit less of a straightforward format, and a little more scenery to play out over time. So instead, I'll just answer the question.\n\nLet's say something like the above happened. The military consolidates, attempts to implement martial law, there's an uprising and the people are fighting an insurgency. Many have died, and urban centers have mostly maintained under martial law while people go out to fight at night (not all, obviously). Rural areas are safe havens, and there aren't really \"mock\" cities or other civilized attempts at life, since drones and artillery and airstrikes are far too easily used to destroy them.\n\nThe people have guns, but mostly small-arms. RPGs, C4, and other explosives are in very short supply. Some vehicles are seized, and other heavy weaponry and gear taken, from military overstock that was sold to some police, but they're still not very effective against tanks and jets and bombers.\n\nNow, the \"war\" has a few ways of going, here. I'm going to try to outline them.\n\n1) The military collapses due to a lack of ability to cohesively function. There's infighting amongst the military, since some defect and realize they're the problem. Consider this similar to a situation like in Libya; eventually defections (and maybe international intervention, even, by nations who are concerned by the instability this is causing the global economy and the possibility this could spread) would take their toll. It's unlikely international governments would side with the US military; the military's presence abroad is spread too thin for them to pose a threat against the major European powers, and they have no incentive to go along with the military when it's clear that's just *causing* the problems. Eventually, the military collapses, a new civilian government is put in power, and the nation tries to rebuild.\n\n2) Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the international powers choose to intervene and help the military. They enter an Afghanistan-like state, fighting an insurgency that not only encompasses a huge nation, but which allows patrols to be picked off. Eventually, the production methods still cause an issue for the military; the destruction of infrastructure makes it harder for *everyone* to function, famine becomes an issue, and the military faces issues getting supplies to itself and to the civilians supporting it. The rest of the populace also suffers, but their raids on the military also take their toll. Tens, if not hundreds of millions die or are displaced or wounded, and either an international takeover of the US or an eventual defeat of the military thanks to the defections becoming far too widespread and demoralization of the remaining soldiers (who are forced to kill everyone from kids to adults) takes its toll.\n\n3) The US military tries an intimidation tactic that's even more forceful. It evacuates all its forces, after attempting to occupy large population centers, from areas that don't post much manufacturing output for them. Things like financial sectors they don't deem necessary for them to function, they pull out of. They then choose to use nuclear weapons to flatten them, making an example. This is extremely unlikely, because it would only encourage a huge outcry internationally, and cause *huge* repercussions, but let's say it happens. The people begin raiding (without much success) nuclear weapons areas to try and get control of them to prevent further attacks, but it's very rough and heavy casualties are inflicted. The military faces *even more* defectors, once news of the nuclear attacks comes out...after all, it's their brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, etc. that are killed. The military gets absolutely decimated by the people thanks to the defections and the eventual access to tactical nuclear weapons that defectors have to attack military leadership. The nation goes to shit, either destroyed by nuclear war or with huge casualties before civilians win.\n\nAll in all, I don't see a way out for the military on this one.\n\nEdit: Wait, so this is where I got gold?

I don't know if it's just college kids flexing their new found argument skills, the rise of Aspies and the socially awkward, or just an increase in people trying to be Sheldon Cooper, but whatever it is, it merely comes across as condescending, arrogant, and dismissive.\n\nFirst off, Logic itself, while in theory is a perfect concept of linear thought, in practice, it is performed in the minds of human beings. Since human beings are inherently flawed and imperfect beings, the \"pureness\" of the Logic will be flawed and imperfect accordingly. Warped by the persons prejudices. Skewed by their assumptions.

Science and Logic may have been used to chart the stars and manufacture the ships, but it was a sea captain's passion that had him sail off the edge of that map, past \"There Be Dragons Here\", and into parts unknown.

You characterize logic by people who use it to dismiss rather than explain, thus characterizing logic using a very emotional argument such as \"don't these logical people do awful things, shouldn't that be taken out on the importance or primacy of logic?\"  \n  \nWell, no, it shouldn't. Just like anger shouldn't be taken out on the value of passion.  \n  \nSo just to sum up an easy response to what you've said:  \nAll judgments people make involve emotions and logic. You can't avoid intellect, because it's entailed in planning, and you'll be using some kind of logic with your intellect whether it's well justified or not. Unless you suffer from a condition where you don't report passion or emotion, we can reason that emotion is present in everyuthinng you do as well. So all in all, they're both present.  \nThat moves on to your CMV being a response to people who claim logic should be more important than emotion, and how much logic should take the helm in whatever it is you're doing. I think that people who are claiming logic should take the lead and have a good argument aren't often the people from the straw man examples you gave of people championing logic. Those good arguments claim logic should take the lead in ways like the following:  \n\n1. have a passion, then plan effectively so you have a better chance of success.  \n2. Experience an emotion, then admit you're experiencing it and choose dispationately which is the best path to solve the situation rather than whatever your first idea was, because you admitted you experienced the emotion and you can admit that first idea might not be well thought out.  \n3. Engage your emotions and don't ignore them in any way, and ensure you don't spend too much time thinking over a plan before you execute it, but rather spend as much time as it takes to make sure your plan should work and isn't emotionally derived or based on slim chances from narrow emotion led perspectives.  \n4. Understand your emotional needs, such as what you are looking for out of a social life. Be sure not to stay in relationships out of an emotional need, but also because you can logically justify that the relationship is healthy for you and them. Obviously emotion alone would designate a social life or not, but the logic would define how often, deeply, and publicly you engage them in conversation, and how specifically you do that.  \n  \n\nI don't see anything wrong with \"logic primacy\" as described in those examples.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

(I swear if I hear \"Straw Man\" one more time, I'll rip my hair out.) I don't know if it's just college kids flexing their new found argument skills, the rise of Aspies and the socially awkward, or just an increase in people trying to be Sheldon Cooper, but whatever it is, it merely comes across as condescending, arrogant, and dismissive.\n\nFirst off, Logic itself, while in theory is a perfect concept of linear thought, in practice, it is performed in the minds of human beings. Since human beings are inherently flawed and imperfect beings, the \"pureness\" of the Logic will be flawed and imperfect accordingly. Warped by the persons prejudices. Skewed by their assumptions. Bent to fit their personal preferences. No human being can actually properly *use* pure logic. At best they can grasp a few of the concepts and buzz words, and flail them around clumsily as either weapon, armor, or both in an argument.\n\nMany seem to think that emotion (passion) leads to the worst of humanity. Anger. Violence. Hate. War. Maybe it does, but it is absolutely worth it in the grand scheme when you realize what good things passion brings to humanity. Art, Music, Philosophy, Discussion, and Literature can all be broken down into mathematics and base components but it was the creator's passion that willed the note from the violin, or streaked brush across canvas. Science and Logic may have been used to chart the stars and manufacture the ships, but it was a sea captain's passion that had him sail off the edge of that map, past \"There Be Dragons Here\", and into parts unknown. While Logic may have provided the map for mankind to explore the sciences and the universe, it is Passion that inspires men in ships to sail the seas and ride $30b tin cans into space. \n\nPassion may be heavy handed and messy, it may be hot headed and make mistakes, but it will ALWAYS trump Logic for bringing humanity further as a race.\n\nThat is why Kirk will always be the captain and Spock will always be supporting him. \n\nNow, all this being said, I'm willing to give a listen as to why being coldly logical is better for humanity than fiery passion, so go ahead and CMV.\n\n*P.S.

I think the more important question since we can all agree that both are quite necessary is where and when do we draw the line? When is it acceptable to use logic and when is it acceptable to express emotions?\n\nWithout logic our emotions take control of us, we feel unconditional love but at the same time growing fear and hate. We can all agree that sex and love takes up the least amount of time but causes the most amount of problems. \n\nWhere does logic come in? When we need to make a right choice? isn't logic just a barrier or basic guidelines we try to set to control our emotions? Then wouldn't the most logical approach be because you really care? and in actuality it is truly based off extreme emotions? Somebody that is willing to put their emotions aside for the time or permanently but because they are so passionate about making the right decision? cause they care that much? \n\nI think you may be confusing logic with cold-bloodedness. Think about why people make logical choices, they make sacrifices, for somebody to be extremely passionate about something they have to make logical decisions to cary out that passion. \n\nWhen you get down to it though, there is no emotion in intelligence and understanding, but there is knowledge and happiness in imagination. \n\nI guess it comes down to your opinion, who you think the fool really is.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"Hi /r/changemyview. I'm sure many of you are familiar with the subreddit /r/tumblrinaction. I'm posting here because I don't really get why so many seem to like it. I feel like I'm going crazy here, because I just realized that the sub has so many of the same qualities as /r/shitredditsays, a sub that I really dislike.  \n\nI want help to reconcile these differences.  \n\nSome things I noticed:  \n\n* Hyperbole and misrepresentation. Obviously it's a circlejerk sub, but I really feel like people there actually believe what they say about what feminists believe. I lurk /r/femradebates a lot and have learned a lot about both MRM and feminism there, and have noticed a huge disconnect between what's said there and what people circlejerk about in TiA. What TiA says about feminists is like what SRS says about MRAs.  \n\n* Outrage culture. It's been getting really bad there lately.. it used to be pretty chill but people are getting so angry and worked up that it feels really toxic now. I browse /r/tiadiscussion and a lot of people seem to agree. There was even a sticky mod post about how to deal with rage... http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/29atw2/official_discussion_thread_dealing_with_rage/  \n\n* Missing sarcasm/obvious jokes, and circlejerking about the opposition anyways. SRS does this a lot with regards to MRAs and they get a lot of flak (rightfully) for it. But then I see things like this on the front page of TiA: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2ag1wy/schizophrenia_does_not_exist_um_because_culture/ and am starting to think that you can post almost anything fake from Tumblr to circlejerk about.  \n\n* Starting to attract actual bigots. SRS can get really bad with the actual communists (eg. Mao/Stalin apologists) and that sucks. I'm a Muslim and I really hate how Tumblr tries to speak on our behalf, but I hate Islamophobes way more. Threads like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/26ag1l/tw_real_life_british_police_let_up_to_50_girls/ were really disheartening to me especially because the article itself was so sensationalist and pretty much made shit up. I had the OP of that thread tagged as an Islamophobic white nationalist before so it sucks to see that actual bigots can get away with using the sub as a political soapbox. :( Plus the whole 4chan vs. Tumblr thing showed that there were a lot of 4chan.org/pol/ users there.. a place that's legitimately fucked up.\n\n* Touching the poop. SRS likes to see themselves as the white knights of reddit who like to call out reddit, but TiA is starting to act like ShitTumblrSays more and more. It's supposed to be a humor sub not the sub that keeps watch over the shit that Tumblrinas say. This one feels so weird... people are even starting to act like the Tumblr police: http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/2af4pv/is_there_are_way_to_report_people_on_tumblr/ that's just what SRS likes to do too when they cry to the reddit admins???  \n\n* This last one is really petty but I feel like the cult of personality around the mods has been getting a bit over the top. The mods of TiA are treated like the archangelles of SRS... it's really weird to me.  \n\nI thought about this for awhile, and I first thought that one major difference between the two subreddits is that TiA doesn't ban anybody with a different opinion like SRS does. But when I thought about it some more I realized that since SRS is so unpopular and TiA is so popular that TiA doesn't need any mod enforcement to make the sub a circlejerk. ~~I remember seeing someone try to support Affirmative Action on the sub and they got hammered with downvotes even when they were being completely reasonable.~~ (this part made the thread go in a direction i didn't care about so I'm removing it)\n\ntl;dr: I'm starting to dislike TiA because it's become like a mirror of /r/shitredditsays. Please convince me where I'm wrong! It just feels really weird to laugh at SRS types when the sub acts just like them.  \n\n---  \n\nedit: I'm gonna head to bed. I enjoyed reading your responses and will respond to as many more as I can when I wake up. I kinda got distracted by arguing about affirmative action when i didn't really want this thread to focus on that, but that's my fault. I'm just looking for arguments that the sub is moving in a positive direction away from being a mirror of SRS!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I'm posting here because I don't really get why so many seem to like it. I feel like I'm going crazy here, because I just realized that the sub has so many of the same qualities as /r/shitredditsays, a sub that I really dislike.  \n\nI want help to reconcile these differences.  \n\nSome things I noticed:  \n\n* Hyperbole and misrepresentation. Obviously it's a circlejerk sub, but I really feel like people there actually believe what they say about what feminists believe. I lurk /r/femradebates a lot and have learned a lot about both MRM and feminism there, and have noticed a huge disconnect between what's said there and what people circlejerk about in TiA. What TiA says about feminists is like what SRS says about MRAs.  \n\n* Outrage culture. It's been getting really bad there lately.. it used to be pretty chill but people are getting so angry and worked up that it feels really toxic now. I browse /r/tiadiscussion and a lot of people seem to agree. There was even a sticky mod post about how to deal with rage... http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/29atw2/official_discussion_thread_dealing_with_rage/  \n\n* Missing sarcasm/obvious jokes, and circlejerking about the opposition anyways. SRS does this a lot with regards to MRAs and they get a lot of flak (rightfully) for it. But then I see things like this on the front page of TiA: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2ag1wy/schizophrenia_does_not_exist_um_because_culture/ and am starting to think that you can post almost anything fake from Tumblr to circlejerk about.  \n\n* Starting to attract actual bigots. SRS can get really bad with the actual communists (eg. Mao/Stalin apologists) and that sucks. I'm a Muslim and I really hate how Tumblr tries to speak on our behalf, but I hate Islamophobes way more. Threads like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/26ag1l/tw_real_life_british_police_let_up_to_50_girls/ were really disheartening to me especially because the article itself was so sensationalist and pretty much made shit up. I had the OP of that thread tagged as an Islamophobic white nationalist before so it sucks to see that actual bigots can get away with using the sub as a political soapbox. :( Plus the whole 4chan vs. Tumblr thing showed that there were a lot of 4chan.org/pol/ users there.. a place that's legitimately fucked up.\n\n* Touching the poop. SRS likes to see themselves as the white knights of reddit who like to call out reddit, but TiA is starting to act like ShitTumblrSays more and more. It's supposed to be a humor sub not the sub that keeps watch over the shit that Tumblrinas say. This one feels so weird... people are even starting to act like the Tumblr police: http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/2af4pv/is_there_are_way_to_report_people_on_tumblr/ that's just what SRS likes to do too when they cry to the reddit admins???  \n\n* This last one is really petty but I feel like the cult of personality around the mods has been getting a bit over the top. The mods of TiA are treated like the archangelles of SRS... it's really weird to me.  \n\nI thought about this for awhile, and I first thought that one major difference between the two subreddits is that TiA doesn't ban anybody with a different opinion like SRS does. But when I thought about it some more I realized that since SRS is so unpopular and TiA is so popular that TiA doesn't need any mod enforcement to make the sub a circlejerk. ~~I remember seeing someone try to support Affirmative Action on the sub and they got hammered with downvotes even when they were being completely reasonable.~~ (this part made the thread go in a direction i didn't care about so I'm removing it)\n\ntl;dr: I'm starting to dislike TiA because it's become like a mirror of /r/shitredditsays. Please convince me where I'm wrong! It just feels really weird to laugh at SRS types when the sub acts just like them.  \n\n---  \n\nedit: I'm gonna head to bed. I enjoyed reading your responses and will respond to as many more as I can when I wake up. I kinda got distracted by arguing about affirmative action when i didn't really want this thread to focus on that, but that's my fault. I'm just looking for arguments that the sub is moving in a positive direction away from being a mirror of SRS!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You absolutely are and clearly those who have more and give very little of it help finance things more than a collective of persons with meager wealth.  The point I was initially making was that \"generous\" is a very high praise to offer someone and I feel that it can at least sometimes be perceived as a cheap way earning praise for very little.  I'm reminded of [the Biblical story](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12:41-44) of the woman who gave her last cents in offering and was praised by Jesus as giving more than anyone else.

We give most of our money away discretely (but never anonymously because that is actually a bad thing to do) so aren't looking for applause but are often called generous. We cringe a bit at this but the reality is compared to others it is true. And non-profits calling people generous is not only a way of being grateful but more importantly encourages others to do the same.\n\nI don't think it's really fair to judge people without knowing them. The people I know that give, even those who give large amounts and enjoy the publicity, give because they care. Sure there are those who buy a girl scout cookie box out of guilt or donate $10,000 to a shelter to get people to quit bugging them at a fundraiser but for the most part they give because they actually care not because they have to.

Make it a rule that unless sacrifice of some sort factors into your gift, you are not being generous.  Therefore, if I donate money to an AIDS research foundation and as a direct result cannot buy the new fancier computer I wanted, then I am generous.  If a millionaire donates proportionately the same amount but it forces them to change nothing, then they are not.  The bigger the sacrifice, the more generous the person.  And yes, if a millionaire decides to donate the money they intended to spend on a yacht meaning they don't get a boat or even get a smaller one than what they wanted, I'd consider that a sacrifice and therefore that they were being generous.\n\nI also add that I personally value the gift of time and effort above most monetary gifts because that's something that everyone values about the same.\n\n\n**EDIT** *I've awarded a delta to /u/gaviidae for [their comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2bag31/cmv_we_should_stop_calling_millionaires_and/cj3e0bt) about judgement and for making me realize that right or wrong, no good would come from employing this view in any practical sense.*\n\n**EDIT 2** *Stepped away for a few hours and this thing got way bigger than I expected so I likely will not be able to reply to every single comment.  That being said, there are some common themes I've seen come up in many of them so I'll attempt to address those here.  I will try to dive back into the comments, but I'm working overnight tonight (EST) and as you may be able to tell from the times I've posted already, have not been able to sleep today. *\n\n*1) I realize I can be tone deaf when communicating sometimes, but I did not mean to imply that not being called generous specifically means you are not doing something good.  You absolutely are and clearly those who have more and give very little of it help finance things more than a collective of persons with meager wealth.  The point I was initially making was that \"generous\" is a very high praise to offer someone and I feel that it can at least sometimes be perceived as a cheap way earning praise for very little.  I'm reminded of [the Biblical story](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12:41-44) of the woman who gave her last cents in offering and was praised by Jesus as giving more than anyone else.  That's basically the comparison I'm making.*\n\n*2) This view was not in any way meant to comment on how people should receive donations/gifts.  Any gift given freely is worth thanking and worthy of praise from the recipient.*\n\n*3) Nowhere in my view did I state or insinuate that anyone was entitled to anything.  I have several rich friends and don't believe for a second that I'm entitled to any of their money at all.  What rich people feel is their responsibility to give is no one's business but their own.*\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially.\n\nI'll make two quick points with the idea of persuading you that, while it should be simplified, a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function.\n\nFirst, take criminal law. Let's assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad. That sounds fine and dandy at first, but who defines what is morally bad? Some things are clear cut - hitting a small child would be morally bad. But what if hitting them prevented some greater harm? Going down this train of logic will ultimately lead to a purely utilitarian theory on the legal system. That isn't to say that it would be better or worse than our's currently, but given the immense literature on utilitarianism I doubt any high schooler could reasonably be expected to memorize it.\n\nSecond, let's look at regulation by profession, specifically bank regulation. If you haven't heard of Dodd-Frank, well, lucky you. It's a 800-odd page legislative titan. I would hardly believe it couldn't be slimmed down some, yet a lot of it is necessary for a functional judicial system to determine what is and is not legal. Take the Volcker rule and prop. trading. That's explicitly illegal now (well, kind of... not yet). There isn't a huge moral justification to regulations such as these other than 'they increase risk and excessive risk is bad'. But who defines what excessive risk is? If you have a probability of default of 50% is that bad? Is 15% acceptable? What about 5%? Even better, what about 4.99999% versus 5%? Some of these things just ultimately need someone saying \"Enough! We'll agree on 5% or we will agree to disagree.\" and to codify it. However, that codification, even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws, would be immense.\n\nIn short, my two points were: 1. We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory). 2. In order to eliminate discrepancies, the system needs to codify at least some specific instances, and by doing such for an immense number of actions we go beyond, well, *any* one person's memory.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

I'm **not** saying simple enough that **all** high school students **should** memorize them; I'm saying simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so. Like, most people don't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet. But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.**\n\n(2.) I'm not interested in hearing any arguments that are based in any way on what the laws are, right now, except by way of comparison. This includes the constitution. Seriously -- this isn't what I want to argue here, but I'm 100% on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents, so appealing to the constitution is not on topic.\n\nI'm not a fan of extreme simplification, but I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity. I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.\n\nIdeally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.\n\nBy categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession (medical, construction, IT, and so on). \n\nI'd be fine with memorizing all the laws being a feat on par with memorizing the Bible; but it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.\n\nEdit 9:55: CLARIFICATIONS BASED ON CONFUSION THAT HAS OCCURRED:\n\n(1.) I am not arguing that a shorter legal code is by definition easy to understand. I am not arguing that the average High School student should be able to achieve a lawyer's level of expertise in any given aspect. I'm defending the memorization criterion as a way to limit the total length and vagueness of a set of laws.\n\nEDIT 8:35 the following morning: Nobody last night since I went to bed made any points that I haven't already addressed more than once, so I'm done individually responding unless somebody comes up with something new.

Sometimes, when a person (anyone really) decides to eat for any reason other than to provide fuel for their body it's a symptom of other issues. Some people over eat to soothe their emotions. They use the food as a buffer or comfort from their emotional distress. For these people, the food isn't the issue. It's the emotions underneath it all. Some people eat out boredom or to distract themselves from painful memories. Being obese goes a lot deeper than just having some will power. But if you're trying to motivate an obese person to loose weight, you have to remember that not every method will be effective for all. It's true that some people may respond to shaming as a wake up call to take control of their heath, but the majority will not. You also need to examine your own motives for thinking this way. Do you shame them out of genuine concern for their health or because you're horrified that you were once overweight as well?

Fox News understands that news is a form of entertainment, and they have understood that from the beginning. They understand that *all* news is influenced by opinions and personality, and that simply going on air and reading the \"straight\" news off a teleprompter is deadly boring. Like, CSPAN-boring. Fox makes watching the news an entertaining experience, and **that is why they get the ratings**.\n\nFox's entire news production team is devoted to entertaining people and keeping them coming back for more. So they hire larger-than-life personalities (Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilley, Ann Coulter, etc.). They mingle the news with opinions, because they know that everyone has opinions and is (secretly) interested in other people's opinions. Fox has always led the way in developing exciting graphics, innovative formats, hiring interesting talent, etc (not to mention great non-news programming on the channel).  \n\nPeople don't watch Fox News because it's more informative. They watch because it's more entertaining. It also happens to be a right-leaning conservative news channel, but the exact same format and approach can work regardless of the politics behind the production. That's why you've seen CNN, MSNBC and other news programs begin to adopt a lot of Fox's approaches to broadcast news: engaging personalities, fluff stories, strong opinions, conflict, drama, scandal.  \n\nConservative newspapers pioneered this approach. The conservative New York Post -- the paper made famous for headlines like \"[Headless Body In Topless Bar](http://nypost.com/2010/02/22/83-killer-in-denial/)\" -- has understood that it's first job is to entertain for decades now.

Universities ran a broad gamut, with different levels of quality, focusing on different areas, having different strengths and weaknesses, and representing an extremely wide range of differing policies.\n\nThis makes it difficult to project any individual's experience onto the broader world of higher education.\n\n\n#*What, precisely, is a \"scam\"?*\nA scam involves active deception and an intent to defraud. For higher education to qualify as a scam, we would have to believe that most universities deceive their students: that either they are collaborating to keep prices artificially high, or that they provide a poorer education than they claim.\n\nThis seems farfetched to me, BUT you may be using \"scam\" simply to mean a bad deal. Let's think about that:\n\n\n#*Is higher education a good deal?*\nBasically, the answer is yes. It depends *a lot* on which school you attend and what to do afterward, but there is very strong evidence that people with college degrees fair better. Right now, the unemployment rate for high school graduates is 6.4%, while it is 3.4% for college graduates [[Link]](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm). The average 30-year return on investment for a college degree is somewhere around $1 million. [This site](http://www.payscale.com/college-education-value-2013) has ROI estimates broken down by school for 2013. Most people eventually come out ahead with a college degree.\n\nHaving said this, there are cases where it probably doesn't make sense to go to college. It's not for everyone and every situation.\n\nSo, why is college so expensive? Where is it all going? Why are costs increasing? Why does it *feel* scammy?\n\n#*There ARE scammy aspects to higher education*\nYou mentioned textbooks. Depending on your definitions, they probably do qualify as scams. Some revisions are good, we want up-to-date information, but I've also seem publishers who change almost nothing (except page numbers) between editions. And university bookstores are pretty sketchy. Students are MUCH better off renting or buying books on the internet.\n\n\n#*Schools are focusing increasingly on improving non-academic facilities*\nUniversities usually don't compete on price. Students feel like a price relates to quality, so no school wants to be thought of as a \"bargain.\" Instead they compete on academic reputation (hiring rockstar professors), facilities (private dorm rooms, organic cafeterias, state-of-the-art labs, etc), and sports.\n\nAll of this is expensive and raises costs and is arguably unnecessary. But schools are doing this in response to consumer preferences, it's not a scam.\n\n\n#*Professor quality can be hit-or-miss*\nSchools want professors who will increase their academic reputation. This means professors that conduct high-profile research, publish frequently in high-impact journals, and/or are generally well known. Actual teaching ability isn't as important as it should be.\n\nIn addition, many schools are increasing their reliance on adjunct professors to handle the brunt of student instruction. These are usually entry-level, non tenure-track positions. This isn't fantastic either.\n\n\n#*The whole student loan scene is dodgy*\nA whole other article could be written about this, but the bottom line is that there are a lot of people making a lot of money by convincing students to take on more debt than they really need to. This also contributes indirectly to rising costs.\n\n\n##Bottom line: I don't think the university system (in the US) is a scam.\nFundamentally, US Universities are generally regarded as being among the best in the world. The best research is still being done in higher education, it's still the hub of intellectualism in our country, and it is still the best way to gain a the education necessary for a good career.\n\nIt's not for everyone, and there are some bad parts to it. But the bad parts are not representative of higher education as a whole. There are also a lot of exciting developments in the world of online learning that might disrupt the traditional university experience. Still, earning a college degree is generally a good idea and is generally a good value.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

I work as a staff member at a public research university in the midwest. I thought I'd take a stab at addressing some of your concerns.\n\nFor starters, there are a number of different colleges and universities to choose from in the United States. There are very affordable community colleges, there are public universities (like mine) that have become increasingly expensive due to a seemingly constant reduction in the amount of government funding received, and there are incredibly expensive private universities that charge tens of thousands of dollars a year. Then, in addition to all of these traditional schools, you also have non-traditional for-profit schools, which are another issue entirely, but let's focus on the traditional settings - community colleges and four year universities, both public and private.\n\n&gt; The majority of my professors are not efficient teachers of their respective subjects. \n\nResearch universities in particular have always placed more emphasis on hiring scholars who have shown excellence in their chosen field of study. Why? Because those scholars will bring prestige to their institution as they continue to contribute to their fields. There are few, if any, requirements for instructional competency among faculty members at research universities. You'll probably have a better shot at finding a really good professor who is also a great teacher at a liberal arts university or a community college, where research may still occur, but isn't the primary focus.\n\n&gt; Each year the required books for the courses are updated (rarely have I been able to use the same book twice.. I don't understand how basic math/science can change every year..) and are extremely expensive. \n\nYes, textbooks are incredibly expensive. I agree with you. It sucks. I think this is the one part of your argument that can truly be considered a scam. Thankfully, there are many more textbook-purchasing options available to students today than there were in 1998, when I started college (and was shocked to find that I had to nearly empty my checking account at the campus bookstore on the very first day.)\n\n&gt; I am forced to pay extra (on top of my tuition) to have access to online homework that is required for the course. \n\nThis is not universal. Each school has its own unique fee structure. Some institutions itemize the fees. Others are all-inclusive. As part of my job, I supervise an online industry-specific certificate program. The students interact only with their professors. However, behind those professors is a team of online course designers, system administrators, billing clerks, and coordinators like me who keep all the gears moving. For every professor you interact with, there are probably two or three staff members behind the scenes, making sure the lights are on, the servers work, the classrooms are scheduled, grades are submitted, etc. All the people who do these things cost money. And so do the professors - sometimes they cost a LOT of money. Your professor's job isn't to pay bills, submit invoices, manage websites, or enter data. Your professor is there to teach. The staff do all the heavy lifting behind the scenes, and no higher education institution could run without them.\n\n&gt; Every professor seems to have a different system to disseminate information, so I have to keep track of 4-5 different websites just to ensure I don't miss an important announcement or assignment. Many times I feel I am paying thousands of dollars to be told to teach myself.\n\nAgain, this is not universal, as some universities (such as my own) have standard online portals used for student-faculty interaction. Some universities aren't there yet, though, leaving individual faculty to find what works best for their courses. This all goes back to the whole lack of a formalized \"university system\" in the United States. \n\n&gt; Much of the subject matter is available online, for free.. and it is presented in a MUCH better format (kahn academy, code academy, w3 schools etc...). Such a high priority is placed on grades and exams (above functional knowledge of the material), that I've observed many students taking shortcuts just to keep their GPA up, and not really learning the material in a useful way.\n\nCode Academy may work better for some students, yourself included. Other students may benefit from having access to an expert who can provide additional information that may aid in the comprehension of subject matter. And guess where those experts are? Universities. Oh, and those experts need to be paid to be there. As do the people who help them do their jobs.\n\n&gt; That being said, I do not think that the entire experience is worthless.. I have met some great people, and learned from some good teachers. Unfortunately this experience has been the exception, not the rule.\n\nNegativity aside, in addition to the learning that takes place in a university classroom, I found that I learned a lot of useful social skills while I was a student. I met people from different backgrounds, different cultures, and with views that challenged my own. While we may go to universities and colleges to learn about a specific subject, the experience can also be one that prepares us to coexist with those different from us. In a traditional university setting, students have a safe environment in which they can develop a well-rounded and better informed view of the world in which they live (which happens to be a world filled with all sorts of people.)\n\n&gt; I feel that since a University is the only place you can officially earn a degree, they have a captive audience (one that has been indoctrinated by years of 'Go to college or you'll be a bum' propaganda). I feel they take advantage of this fact in an attempt to extract enormous amounts of money (that place students in crippling dept).\n\nIt depends on the degree, naturally. You'll have more earning potential with a STEM degree or a business degree than with a studio art degree. However, as others have already pointed out, earning potential and employment opportunities are, on average, higher for those with a bachelor's degree than for those without, and it's definitely not the right choice for everyone.\n\nAnd, going back to the cost issue, I'd like to reiterate two very important factors:\n\n1. Professors (and the staff members who support their work) need to be paid, too.\n2. Public universities in the United States have had to make serious cuts due to the recent financial crisis, which resulted in decreases in tax revenues. In fact, [43 states have slashed budgets in recent years](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=1214). And when push comes to shove, politicians will always choose to provide more funding things like transportation, K-12 education (which is mandated), and law enforcement than for things like higher education, since that isn't a requirement, and the costs can be passed along to students.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to say that the vast majority of faculty and staff at universities want you to succeed. We're not there to bankrupt you. We're not there to make things hard for you. We want you to do well, and to go out and make the world a better place with what you've learned. But we also need to be paid for the work we do. And believe me, most staff members are severely underpaid, and could be making more money someplace else. The same goes for a lot of faculty members. Nobody is trying to scam you. Nobody (at least nobody I know) is getting rich off of you.\n\nWhen you pay for your university education, you're paying not for something tangible. You're paying for an opportunity to learn from experts, and to take that knowledge to make a better life for yourself and your family. Paying your tuition doesn't entitle you to anything other than a seat in a classroom. What you do with that is up to you.\n\nEducation is not a commodity. Education is something you experience.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"Hey all!\n\nI'm talking about the really big unions, with hundreds or thousands of local groups and up to hundreds of thousands of members. I'm emphatically not talking about small, independent unions formed to fight for workers.\n\nThe impression I've gotten from media coverage is that large unions have a few principal problems that combine to make rather unhelpful organizations:\n\n* Large unions tend, from what I've seen, to have a leadership clique that has its own views that aren't necessarily the views of the majority of workers, often by way of things like the current set of executive nominating the new executive, and having them ratified by a large percentage of workers who will vote the union ticket without much thinking. The result is that over time, the union leadership tends to just be the people who will keep the union going in the same direction. It doesn't help that radicalism sounds sexy, and so the elected leaders tend to be very strongly pro-union. This tendency towards a certain kind of person in charge tends, I think, to encourage the other issues I have with them.\n* Large unions seem to love to treat labour unions like an end and not a means. They often give the impression of forgetting that the fundamental purpose of a union is collective bargaining, and instead become large lobby organizations that use their member dues to fight in the political arena. An excellent example is when a union representing some, but not all, workers at a given employer manages to get a deal requiring all employees to be unionized. While this might sound good on the face of it, if the employer (say, a construction worker) also wishes to hire employees in a job that isn't normally unionized (say, HR), this puts a tremendous drag on the employer and ultimately isn't likely to benefit the represented employees.\n* Large unions seem to invariably end up in the political arena on things not directly related to their fundamental work. It is entirely understandable for a union of any size to be in the political arena arguing for and against measures that directly relate to its fundamental work of collective bargaining, such as by arguing against a back-to-work bill, or lobbying for anti-scab legislation, the bigger unions seem to often go beyond that by arguing for things that affect \"the working-class\", such as arguing for lower taxes. On the face of it, this seems like their job, because they represent workers, but in reality, I think that unions should stay out of these debates because it is not their job to dictate the political preferences of their members. They may have members who want to pay more tax and get more public services, and they may have members who want the government to stay out of their lives. They are members of the union for an imminently practical reason and should not be forced into conflict on political grounds. (Even worse, some unions seem to go even farther into the political arena, coming up with positions on things like Israeli-Palestinian relations, which have nothing to do with their members' jobs or well-being)\n* Lastly, and probably most importantly, the big unions seem to often be extremely insensitive to the employers' needs, ultimately to the detriment of the workers they represent. The unions get into a narrow state of mind where increased wages and benefits are always seen as good things, regardless of the cost. The most egregious example of this is Hostess Foods, which recently closed its doors because the union refused to come to terms. Ultimately, the union's decision to hold out did not help any of its members; instead, they all lost their jobs because the demands were too steep. For a longer-term example, the auto industry in the USA was done in by increasing union-derived benefits which they had to pay for, draining more and more from the companies until they could no longer support themselves. I'm going to lump things like seniority systems in here as well: they benefit certain workers (the ones who perform less well) at the expense of the employer (who may find great difficulty acquiring competent workers for a position, and accordingly suffer from inefficiencies or worse things). Public sector unions have a special place here in my heart, because the nature of their bargaining position is different than a private-sector one. Almost without exception, a public sector union does not have to worry about accidentally driving their employer bankrupt. Instead, their ultimate failure is political: the government simply legislates a solution that the union can do nothing about. This is politically costly, however, and the unions do their best to make it as costly as possible, so the result can be utter silliness in the public sector. I believe I've been told that the Thatcher union busts were driven in part by a union demand that all children of union workers be guaranteed jobs for life.\n\nI think that unions definitely have a very positive role to play in securing workers against abuses by employers and ensuring fair working environment, and especially have had an important role historically in developing modern workers' rights. But I feel that the game has changed and large unions' modern activities do not always properly represent those they claim to serve, and that ultimately their activities have become more of a negative influence than a positive one.\n\nCMV.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the great replies.

Please note: I am Canadian, and my opinions are coloured by my experiences here in Canada. In particular, referencing specific laws of the USA is not helpful since they don't affect the unions here.

On top of that I received tuition benefits (up to $3,000/yr), health insurance, dental &amp; vision, childcare benefits (I dont have kids), a week of paid vacation a year, and a few sick days. I want to reiterate again that this was part time, unskilled manual labor. During the same time I was employed part time by a large research hospital for research related to my field of study. My job at this hospital, doing graduate-level medical research gave me a whopping ($10/hr) and absolutely no benefits. The point of this is that union membership often comes with a lot of perks. That being said, the big trend right now (in the US) to limit/break/bust unions is not coming from the individual level of businesses but is coming from the policy level with initiatives like right-to-work. Strategists have figured out that the single best way to harm unions is to decrease/limit their membership. This causes a decrease in union dues, and a decrease in union power/influence which becomes a kind of downward spiral. The only way for the unions to fight back these initiatives is also at the policy level via lobbying. A union that doesn't do this is leaving itself vulnerable from the top.\n\nAnd finally, your last point about insensitivity to business needs. While there is a decent amount of negativity (some rightly so) to union job perks, and how difficult it is to get fired from a union job, it has some serious advantages for for the business as well. From my limited understanding, a union contract is kind of like the business sub-contracting out its labor. So the company I worked for had very little to do with the workforce in terms of disciplinary action and the union was responsible for making sure everything got done. So if you skipped out on work one day, it was oftentimes union reps who you would have to answer to not company management. For the company I worked for, this had advantages in sense that there were maybe 10 non-union managers and ~50-75 union employees who in essence self-regulate themselves via union reps who were also workers. Now specifically to your point about 'large' unions, the thing about my former employer using this union was that if the shop was short-staffed for some reason, oftentimes other union workers from nearby locations (same employer, different location) would come in to fill in. That is certainly an advantage for the business.\n\nI realize that a lot of this is anecdotal and may not speak to other unions, but my view on the issue is that union labor works for some businesses and not for others. So while unions might 'cause more problems than they solve' in some fields, they are highly beneficial to others. The only way for unions to keep themselves alive and well is through political lobbying and growth as that increases their influence, membership, and dues. Unions aren't perfect, but at the end of the day they are one of the few large organizations that advocate for laborers on all levels from policy &amp; gov't down to individual perks and benefits. \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"Hey all!\n\nI'm talking about the really big unions, with hundreds or thousands of local groups and up to hundreds of thousands of members. I'm emphatically not talking about small, independent unions formed to fight for workers.\n\nThe impression I've gotten from media coverage is that large unions have a few principal problems that combine to make rather unhelpful organizations:\n\n* Large unions tend, from what I've seen, to have a leadership clique that has its own views that aren't necessarily the views of the majority of workers, often by way of things like the current set of executive nominating the new executive, and having them ratified by a large percentage of workers who will vote the union ticket without much thinking. The result is that over time, the union leadership tends to just be the people who will keep the union going in the same direction. It doesn't help that radicalism sounds sexy, and so the elected leaders tend to be very strongly pro-union. This tendency towards a certain kind of person in charge tends, I think, to encourage the other issues I have with them.\n* Large unions seem to love to treat labour unions like an end and not a means. They often give the impression of forgetting that the fundamental purpose of a union is collective bargaining, and instead become large lobby organizations that use their member dues to fight in the political arena. An excellent example is when a union representing some, but not all, workers at a given employer manages to get a deal requiring all employees to be unionized. While this might sound good on the face of it, if the employer (say, a construction worker) also wishes to hire employees in a job that isn't normally unionized (say, HR), this puts a tremendous drag on the employer and ultimately isn't likely to benefit the represented employees.\n* Large unions seem to invariably end up in the political arena on things not directly related to their fundamental work. It is entirely understandable for a union of any size to be in the political arena arguing for and against measures that directly relate to its fundamental work of collective bargaining, such as by arguing against a back-to-work bill, or lobbying for anti-scab legislation, the bigger unions seem to often go beyond that by arguing for things that affect \"the working-class\", such as arguing for lower taxes. On the face of it, this seems like their job, because they represent workers, but in reality, I think that unions should stay out of these debates because it is not their job to dictate the political preferences of their members. They may have members who want to pay more tax and get more public services, and they may have members who want the government to stay out of their lives. They are members of the union for an imminently practical reason and should not be forced into conflict on political grounds. (Even worse, some unions seem to go even farther into the political arena, coming up with positions on things like Israeli-Palestinian relations, which have nothing to do with their members' jobs or well-being)\n* Lastly, and probably most importantly, the big unions seem to often be extremely insensitive to the employers' needs, ultimately to the detriment of the workers they represent. The unions get into a narrow state of mind where increased wages and benefits are always seen as good things, regardless of the cost. The most egregious example of this is Hostess Foods, which recently closed its doors because the union refused to come to terms. Ultimately, the union's decision to hold out did not help any of its members; instead, they all lost their jobs because the demands were too steep. For a longer-term example, the auto industry in the USA was done in by increasing union-derived benefits which they had to pay for, draining more and more from the companies until they could no longer support themselves. I'm going to lump things like seniority systems in here as well: they benefit certain workers (the ones who perform less well) at the expense of the employer (who may find great difficulty acquiring competent workers for a position, and accordingly suffer from inefficiencies or worse things). Public sector unions have a special place here in my heart, because the nature of their bargaining position is different than a private-sector one. Almost without exception, a public sector union does not have to worry about accidentally driving their employer bankrupt. Instead, their ultimate failure is political: the government simply legislates a solution that the union can do nothing about. This is politically costly, however, and the unions do their best to make it as costly as possible, so the result can be utter silliness in the public sector. I believe I've been told that the Thatcher union busts were driven in part by a union demand that all children of union workers be guaranteed jobs for life.\n\nI think that unions definitely have a very positive role to play in securing workers against abuses by employers and ensuring fair working environment, and especially have had an important role historically in developing modern workers' rights. But I feel that the game has changed and large unions' modern activities do not always properly represent those they claim to serve, and that ultimately their activities have become more of a negative influence than a positive one.\n\nCMV.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the great replies. I'm going to go through tomorrow to reply in more detail than I can tonight. There's at least one delta coming. Please note: I am Canadian, and my opinions are coloured by my experiences here in Canada. In particular, referencing specific laws of the USA is not helpful since they don't affect the unions here. Referencing USA unions, etc. as examples is fine since there's a lot of cross-pollination and general tactics are similar (heck, I did that in my post).\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does the following counterargument change your mind?: \"&gt;Large unions tend, from what I've seen, to have a leadership clique that has its own views that aren't necessarily the views of the majority of workers\n\nDo you also believe that government causes more problems than it solves? Union leadership is voted in, reflecting the will of the members.\n\n&gt;An excellent example is when a union representing some, but not all, workers at a given employer manages to get a deal requiring all employees to be unionized. While this might sound good on the face of it, if the employer (say, a construction worker) also wishes to hire employees in a job that isn't normally unionized (say, HR), this puts a tremendous drag on the employer and ultimately isn't likely to benefit the represented employees.\n\nThis is not normally the case - generally unions will require union labor for the work that they do. Work outside of that is either ignored or in cases of unions banding together, specifying what work would be covered under union labor.\n\nHR represents a management function, I've never heard of a union taking HR reps. \n\n&gt;by arguing for things that affect \"the working-class\", such as arguing for lower taxes\n\nWhen they know the income of their employees, which are substantially all the same, why would it be outside their scope to lobby for lower taxes on their employees? \n\n&gt;Lastly, and probably most importantly, the big unions seem to often be extremely insensitive to the employers' needs, ultimately to the detriment of the workers they represent.\n\nWith Hostess, I would argue that the union knew where it's stopping point was. When risking lowering wages for all it's employees across multiple employers, at some point you have to say that the pay cut one employer is saying is required is too much, or risk diluting the pay of your employees over multiple employers. \n\nI would also point out that the union in the Hostess case, what they were asking would not have made hostess unprofitable. At no point was Hostess losing money, and if they signed the contact as the union suggested, Hostess would not be losing money. \n\nThe owners wanted to sell the company, and the unions were bringing down their price. They closed up shop to shed union labor, then sold their business. Those jobs would have been sold off anyway - the owners had been trying to sell prior. Those jobs would have been lost anyway. Why dilute your value with other employers when some asshat is trying to negotiate below industry wages in order to make themselves more look more profitable to a buyer, who most likely will move the jobs anyway?\n\nNot withstanding your above points, even if you disagree with all of my responses, unemployment in the US is driving down labor costs. The only way for workers in a lot of 'low barrier entry' jobs to negotiate is to negotiate collectively. This is huge. Like 'can my family eat' huge.

There are people with large families who go through enormous amounts of dirty dishes in a day. There are disabled people who can't physically stand at the sink long enough to do dishes. There are busy people who want their chores to take a little less long. A dishwasher isn't magical. It isn't going to scrub your pots or dry everything perfectly. It's not going to load itself or put your dishes away. It isn't going to tuck your kids into bed at night. But if you use it properly, a dishwasher can save you a lot of time. And it can make it possible for people who are disabled to live alone and take care of themselves.\n\nNow as to your personal issues, here are my suggestions. Read the manual for your dishwasher and make sure you're using the right stuff for it and following instructions. When you're done with a dish, remove any remaining food and rinse it before putting it in. Not wash it, just rinse it for a second. It also helps if you do this promptly after a dish is used so stuff doesn't have time to cake and grow. When putting in tupperware, make sure that you load it so that the water drains out properly. When the dishwasher finishes running, you may want to open it...that's one way to get remaining things to dry faster. \n\nNow yes, you still have to do some work. You have to scrape off any leftover food, lightly rinse the plates, put the dishes in properly and such. But you know what you don't have to do? Wash each dish fully.  \n\nIf that isn't enough of a benefit for you and you feel like you wasted your money, well, I'm sorry. But that's all dishwashers are intended to do, and it's something that many of the rest of us find valuable enough to spend the money on. \n\nIf you'd like to rant some more about how your dishwasher sucks, try another sub.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

I personally don't care for baseball, but it is fun for people who enjoy statistics.  Because of the nature of the game, every player's effectiveness can be broken down into a series of stats (ERA, RBIs, hits, on base percentage, batting average, etc.).  This means that anyone who has fun studying or playing around with numbers has a great deal of things they can analyse about baseball.\n\nPersonally, I find American Football to be the funnest sport in the world to watch.  Every millisecond that the ball is in play has something important happening, and could potentially only be a few seconds from either team scoring.  Few other sports have the same concentration of excitement.  Meanwhile, in between the snaps, there is a great deal of strategy and mind games involved as each team tries to guess what the other is going to do and adjust accordingly.\n\n&gt;More strategy is involved in soccer and MMA\n\nAs someone who has played all three, I find this idea laughable.  There is very little metagame strategy involved in MMA.  It mostly consists of something along the lines of \"He's better standing, and I'm better on the ground.  So, I want to get him on the ground.\"  Soccer has a bit more strategy, but it is still rather simplistic and mostly relies on execution.  Meanwhile, a football team will completely change the way they play against different teams.  If your opponent has a star wide receiver, then you double cover him.  If their quarterback tends to hold the ball, you pass rush.  At the same time, if you see double coverage, you run plays that pass to a different guy or run it.  If you see a pass rush coming, you use short passes or draw plays.  The strategy is different after every play and needs to be constantly adjusted, rather than being mostly or completely decided before you ever set foot on the field.\n\nWhat I find most enjoyable about the NFL, however, is the sheer athletic prowess demonstrated.  Most sports have a narrow range of body types that tend to do well at the sport, but football has a broad range.  You have hulking behemoths of men who are stronger than just about any other man on the planet and would likely be at home in no other sport besides sumo wrestling.  At the same time, you have men who are as fast as Olympic sprinters and men who can jump clear over another man's head.  These men are all out on the field and for a brief few seconds they are all showing exactly how far the human body can be pushed in each different way.  there is no other sport where you will see such feats of strength, speed, and agility demonstrated at the same time.\n\nAs far as being a good game for entertainment, the start and stop nature of football is excellent for TV.  In between each play there is enough time to show a slow motion replay and have the announcers analyze it without the viewer missing any gameplay.  Constantly moving sports lack this and if you miss a crucial detail in a play, then you will not get a chance to see it again.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

Personally, I don't see many rules that could be taken out of either sport without ruining the spirit of the game. But the claim about \"actual\" game time, is a common one and a silly one. In baseball, the ball is in play the entire time that the pitcher is holding it, and players can (and do) move around strategically. If that isn't gameplay, then give me the definition you're working under. As for football, the pre-snap adjustments are every bit as important as the play itself. Elite offenses move their parts so perfectly that they can guess who is going to be open and when before ever snapping the ball. Peyton Manning isn't just scratching his nuts while he's standing there, he is accounting for the position of everyone on the field and guessing what the defense's plan is.\n\n&gt;More strategy is involved in soccer and MMA\n\nThis is insane. Strategies can revolutionize the game in football. In 2008, the Miami Dolphins brought out the Wildcat offense (involving a direct snap to the HB), and they embarrassed a more talented Patriots team fresh off an 18-1 season. A few short years later, the Wildcat is obsolete, because defenses adapted their strategies. I don't watch much soccer, but when was the last time that type of drastic strategic shift occurred? To go back to Peyton Manning, strategy is the reason he was the best QB in the league last year. He ain't the most athletic guy. [Hell, he looks like my dad.](http://www.sportsgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Peyton-Manning.jpg) He isn't fast, and he doesn't throw the ball particularly hard anymore. And yet he put up otherworldly numbers because he can read the defense so well that he might as well be calling their plays for them. A guy with my dad's physique isn't going to be one of the best soccer players in the world, no matter how high his soccer IQ is.\n\n&gt;more execution is involved in basketball and hockey\n\nWhat does this even mean? Is a perfect pass in the NFL somehow not as good as a perfect hockey or basketball pass? Is it easier to throw a ball 50 yards directly into the hands of someone running full speed than it is to shoot a ball into a basket from 20 feet away? I don't even want to disparage basketball or hockey because they are great sports, but what do you mean by execution here?\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

Very few people do.  It's harder than it sounds.  By imposing artificial limits on what kinds of stuff you can eat, fad diets like atkins and paleo automatically reduce your caloric intake by making it harder to snack casually. You have to *think* about what you're eating to make sure it passes the diet's rules, and if you consciously think about every single meal, you'll probably eat less.  The actual rules don't really matter, though - you could make snacking harder by sticking to a \"diet\" in which you only eat foods that start with letters A-H.  \n\nCounting calories and weighing everything you eat also requires that you think before you eat, but the burden is much higher than sticking to a few simple rules.  Overly burdensome rules lead to what psychologists call \"decision fatigue.\"  If you're forced to make *too many* conscious choices in a day (this includes both food choices and all other choices), your decision-making capacity (aka your willpower) starts to decline.  The best diet and exercise routine is the one that you're able to stick to long enough for it to become a *permanent* part of your lifestyle.  The people who succeed by counting calories often have to keep counting calories *forever* or it's likely that they'll gain the weight back.  Most people are going to get bored or annoyed by the difficulty of estimating the caloric content of everything they eat.  \n\nI think the most successful food restrictions are ones that people adopt as part of their personal identity.  The bigger the dietary change, the more it has to be internalized in order to succeed.  Saying \"I'm a vegan\" is a lot more psychologically powerful than saying \"I observe an arbitrary dietary guideline that prohibits all animal-derived ingredients.\"  Saying \"I belong to Weight Watchers\" is more psychologically powerful than saying \"I assign a certain point value to every food and attempt to stay within a certain daily point range.\"  So do whatever diet you like, as long as you seriously think you're going to be able to stick with it for at *least* several years.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

If you get into an exercise routine, it will be easier to keep weight off in the long run. You can also eat more satisfying meals while you exercise.\n\nThe diet programs generally attempt to make you feel full, and limit your calories.

This is why I think it occurs:\n\n1. Men's chests aren't deemed to be sexual areas, that's why you guys can walk around with your tops off everywhere and it not be 'obscene' or 'public nudity' whereas women walking around with no clothes on top would be. You make the point below that it's your choice where your want to be touched, yes - but society has deemed things that are ok, are sometimes ok and are not ok in public/without consent. So I can tap your shoulder from behind to get your attention, I can probably touch your elbow while flirting, I can't really grab your junk without enthusiastic consent. If your lines are different from society's that's something you have to deal with, not society. The west has deemed men's chests as relatively non-sexual, so you can't expect people to act like your chest is different. \n\n2. The situation. Obviously there will be exceptions to this - but in general women tend to touch men when they are flirting, whereas there's a pretty strong trend for men to just grab at women. There has not been a single club night in which me and my friends have not been grabbed, and often we can't even work out who did it. Ditto with whenever I've been/known a waitress. Whereas whenever I've seen women grab guys asses it tends to be after at least a little flirting, which would not necessarily make it entirely ok, but more a misunderstanding of how far the flirtation has gone rather than just a random, no warning, grabbing. I also haven't had male friends get randomly grabbed, only ever during flirtation.\n\n3. perception of power. There is no denying that average guy is stronger than average girl and that throughout history the power has been on the mans side and that even today men are considered the aggressors. This perhaps shouldn't be the case, and i think we are reaching a place where we realise everyone can be sexually harassed, everyone can be the aggressors. But in the past this hasn't been the case and we always take a while to shake off these double standards. So currently a girl grabbing a guy is seen as fun and flirty, and when he doesn't want it 'oops hahahah' whereas when guys grab a girl when she doesn't want there's an inherent perception of danger (if he's willing to do that when I didn't want it what else is he willing to do?) and in a world of averages the girl is in a situation where the guy fully has the ability to attack her/rape her with her having very little means to defend herself. Whereas (again, world of averages) the guy can usually pretty easily push a girl away if and when she goes too far. But, like I said, I think this is changing.\n\n4. as for the guys then calling each other pussies, this is the double standard of genders and sex. In general women are considered sluts if they sleep around a lot, so will aim to look like they're not sluts, possibly by 'overreacting' to being touched by a guy when they didn't want to be (although some reaction is warranted of course) whereas men are all supposed to be super macho masculine guys and getting all the girls, so seeming to turn one down looks unmasculine. Obviously this double standard hurts both parties in terms of sexual harassment and grabbing, guys are told they should love it when it happens and do it to be a man, girls then get subjected to it. \n\n5. I'm not sure you can show that people don't take it seriously. I think men are less likely to report it as it's seen to be weak, but I think once reported it would be treated the same, although I don't have any stats, do you? \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

All unwanted touches are inappropriate.\n\n/u/Nietzsches-Mustache has done a great job of explaining the psychological aspect of a man touching a woman, but let's talk a little bit about the social aspects of the male and female body.\n\nMan chest vs. Female Chest -- Generally speaking people in Western countries are taught that female breasts are \"private areas\" part of the sexual organs that shouldn't be displayed or touched in a public setting. That status elevates them to \"no touchy\" under most circumstances. Men however can walk topless without fear of being told they are being \"brazen\" or...oh fuck...what's the word...idk...exhibitionist isn't right but it gives the idea. Inappropriate, whatever. So man breast isn't a taboo area of conversation, people wouldn't be like to perceive it as a sexually aggressive move for a woman to touch a man's chest/man boob.\n\nWoman Ass vs Man Ass -- this one's a little harder to break down, however, I think most of the issue with this comes from the social perception of who is normally the sexual aggressor, i.e. the one who initiates flirting and/or sex. Men do. Therefore the action of a man touching a woman's ass is \"typical man behavior\" society has strict rules about this, and it is therefore accepted. A woman touching a man's ass is...rarer and because of the typical perspective that men are the sexually aggressive gender any overt action by women is probably expected to be well received or at least tolerated.\n\nI think this speaks to the reason why lawsuits are easier to win from the female perspective.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

Murphy spent his life researching pedagogical trends across centuries, and what you're describing happened, *kind of*, but not in the way you describe.  Read his work to get the whole story of what I'm saying from the horse's mouth.\n\nHistorically, men taught boys, and the pedagogical style was antagonistic.  A prof would drill his students, and then expect them to memorize every word for the next day's class.  This heavily masculist-focused educational system resulted in major clashes between students and teachers, who were universally despised, including several [armed student insurrections as recently as 1834 at Harvard](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/harvards-long-ago-student-risings/).  \n\nDuring this time period, women began to get formal educations, because a formal education was considered, by the extremely sexist standards of the Victorian era, to be an essential component for the creation of a marriageable upper- and middle-class woman, who would be expected to manage a household, ledgers, and sometimes a staff.  Because of those same sexist standards, however, it was grossly inappropriate to teach women in this way, and as a result they were taught using methods which we would recognize today.\n\nAnd then the West opened up.  With the Louisiana Purchase, the Eastern seaboard depopulated humongously, and no matter where you went, there was work for men to do who wanted it--if you were a settler, you were building or mining or herding or investing or building railroads, and if you stayed on the Eastern seaboard, you could get those lucrative jobs that many of the richer or middle-class men had vacated.  There simply weren't enough hands for the jobs, and teaching had always been an acceptable profession for women in the Victorian mold.\n\nSo, women stepped in where men had gone to seek their fortunes elsewhere, teaching being a less-than-profitable profession in the best of times.  And, since you teach others largely the way that you yourself were taught, these women taught their mostly male pupils in the same way that they had been taught, in a calm, non-confrontational manner.  Eventually, these boys grew up, and wouldn't put up with the bullshit that old-style profs at Harvard and such tried to make them put up with, and universities had to change rapidly and radically to survive.  Antagonistic teaching was gone, and gone forever, within a generation.\n\nWhat you're describing here:\n\n&gt;But, after the feminism movement (mid and post 1930s) had largely made ground, female educators were (similarly to males) siphoned from education as a field and into hard sciences, medical, and law fields. Because of this siphoning, I believe that our education system experienced a crash and has never recovered from it.\n\nalso never happened.  First, women didn't make serious movement into the fields you describe for another 20-30 years.  Second, *after* that point in time, during the 1970s, we had hands down the best education system in the world.  Third, the observations you're making about prize-winning is not significant of the intelligence of the educators but of the comparative specialization you need in order to make discoveries today.  It required a lot more equipment and funding to discover DNA in 1962 than it did for Karl Landstiener to discover blood types for the identical nobel prize in 1930.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

Because you're too busy teaching kids.\n\nI think you're confusing the desire to teach with teaching being *the only option available.*  It's unlikely that people who are absolutely the top in their field, whatever that field is, are going to be interested in being *mere* teachers because teaching, by definition, means you're barely being involved in your chosen field. \n\nIt's disingenuous, and frankly a little too socialism-minded for my taste, to imply that women (or men) who are at the top of their fields be somehow made to remain teachers \"for the good of society\". \n\nThe fact remains that teaching is a low paying job, with no real opportunities for significant recognition, and hinders people from actually participating in making advancements in the field of choice.\n\nBeing good or interested in a subject does not automatically translate to being interested in teaching that subject to others.\n\nedit: Your view doesn't address the fact that many of those advancements would not have been made or would have been made much later if women had *remained mere teachers.* So does society benefit more from top scientists, researchers, and mathematicians actually breaking new ground in those fields or from the top people in those fields being forced to just be teachers? Because you might be able to raise the overall intelligence level of the general public (in my opinion only slightly) but it would be at the cost of actually making scientific and technological advances.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

You know better than I, but my impression is that if the server cannot make at least minimum wage on tips alone, they will be paid that amount anyway by the restaurant. So, you're not actually stiffing them, though I'm sure management will question why they don't get tips and eventually discuss with them their poor behavior and habits. Also, they don't know you, nor can they read your mind, so they have no idea how great of a tipper you are otherwise and just assume you never tip, or something.

Like I said in the previous edit, I had already reached a decision by consulting my wife, my friends and my family, but all the incredible advice and the insightful comment gave me great hope that my decision will be the right one for my career, myself and my family. So here it goes\n\nI have decided to take the construction industry job for the following reasons:\n\n- Right now it is an awful time to be working in the non-profit NGO, where I live. The conservative government has slashed all funding in the environment sector and the provincial government only cares about austerity. If I took the NGO job, I wouldn't even be guarantied to be able to keep it for very long if the meager funding dries out.\n\n- I have been working in the same field, with the same people for over 15 years. I am feel enthusiastic about learning new things and working with new people. Also if I learn the inner workings of the construction industry, I may become much more efficient to enact long term meaningful changes.\n\n- I have been living poor (well much more then most engineer do) for the past 15 and I still have some student loans to reimburse. Banks have constantly been picking at my heels and it will be quite a load of my stress, if I can finally repay then and make then STFU! Also having some form of financial stability would be great for a change.\n\n- Although where I live, our society has quite the safety net and I am assured that my child will never lack of his basic needs whatever salary I make, It would be great to offer my family a better quality of life. Rest assured I am not someone who will have more money go to his head. By nature, I am not a great consumer and I am very likely to put most of my money aside for personal projects and even help out the NGO I had worked for and respect.\n\n- I have dedicated my entire life to fight for the environment and that in not about to change, even if I work in a different field. Over the years I have found that enacting change from the outside of a system is next to impossible, so it will be quite interesting to see if change can be had from the inside. \n\n- My greatest fear is that the construction job asks me to compromise to much on my value and that makes me fall into a depression. In order to prevent this scenario, I will be following the advice given by many of you. Quickly put money aside, so I can safely bail out if thing get to rough and have multiple contingency plan if ever it does. \n\n- Finally I must admit that the money does sound attractive. I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family, I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness, it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me, but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life, I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me) \n\nOnce again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls, their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place, feel free to go out an plant a tree. In the long run it does actually make a difference.

I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family, I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness, it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me, but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life, I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me) \n\nOnce again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls, their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place, feel free to go out an plant a tree. In the long run it does actually make a difference. Ardaron9 out!       \n\nTldr: CMV really worked and I no longer believe that going to work for a big construction company is a huge betrayal of my environmental values.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Only people are.\n\nThe implications of this are:\n\n1. States cannot make decisions.\n\nThe US, for instance, is incapable of independent action. When we say that the US has done this or that, we are actually just using a synecdoche for the actions of the people in the various departments of the government.\n\n2. The people that make decisions in government have an obligation to serve for the benefit of the state's citizens.\n\nWhile this seems obvious, it's important to point out the personal moral obligations are not the same as public moral obligations. The state is a corporate entity that we established because it is better at doing certain things  than private individuals are, like providing security and defense. The state exists for the benefit of the citizens, so when people voluntarily join the government, they are voluntarily accepting the moral obligation to serve for the benefit of the citizens. This means that the have an additional moral obligation that is discrete from their private moral obligations (i.e. a senator have a private moral obligation to help out a friend during a rough time, but this does not impinge on their public obligation. Similarly, the senator may have a public obligation to keep churches from receiving state funds, but this doesn't change his private obligation to donate to his church if he's religious (I know, it's not the best example, but you get the point).\n\n3. The government can only legitimately act in the best interests of its citizens.\n\nThe benefit of the citizens is the only reason that the government exists. Whatever the private, personal obligations are of the members of the government, that is completely separate from their obligation to govern in the best interests of the citizens.\n\n4. It would therefore be illegitimate for a state to intervene in a situation where it does not have a real interest.\n\nAt heart, the biggest problem here is that when you are dealing with the military, those who choose do not act, those who act do not choose. To say that a state has an obligation to intervene is the same as saying that a Senator has a moral obligation to send a young man who he does not know to go and die for the benefit of someone else on the other side of the world. This is absurd. If the Senator believes that he has a moral obligation to help, then he should go himself. To send the military would be the same as imposing members' of government personal views and morality on the country as whole to satisfy their own personal guilt over not acting.\n\n5. It is unreasonable to hold people to involuntary and exceptional moral obligations.\n\nThis is more of a practical argument. Most states are incapable of launching and sustaining a military intervention on the far side of the world. In fact, only the US, and to more limited extent the UK and France currently truly possess this ability. Assuming that you cannot hold someone to an obligation that they cannot possibly fulfill, this means that the US, UK, and France alone have this extraordinary moral obligation to prevent genocide. But remember, when we say the US, UK, and France, we are just talking indirectly about their citizens. This means that if your view is correct, people in these three countries have an obligation to be maimed, killed, and taxed in order to help others, while the rest of the world does not. They have this obligation simply because they happened to be born in a certain geographical area. This is unfair. If people want to take on additional moral obligations, more power to them, and I will whole heatedly support them, but they must be able to do so voluntarily. It is not fair to hoist these kind of obligations onto people simply because they were born in one spot as opposed to another.\n\nTL;DR: States aren't moral actors, only people are. People in government have an obligation to act on what's best for the people. Intervening in crisis that wouldn't otherwise affect the country is not in the peoples interest. Therefore it is illegitimate for States to Intervene.\n\nEDIT: Words are hard.\n\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

People have mentioned medications on here, but many of these medications actually interact with hormone levels.

War from a country's point of view is simply using force as means of exerting it's political will.  That's all it has ever been throughout history.

I mean, I guess the UN forces are technically what you are looking for, but there's no way to volunteer for UN peacekeeping operations, it's just other nation's militaries in blue hats.  But we don't have an actual third party, and largely due to the US' super power status, we are effectively peace keepers.\n\n&gt; I just don't see how going in to kill people can be respected, especially when they are sometimes innocent, a classic example is the \"collateral damage\" video, where it is very clear they are not there for peaceful purposes.\n\nGoing to kill people...that are also killing people.  That rule through violence and fear, that oppress their population. The Taliban and Saddam (And I'm not saying I agree with these reasons...) were not exactly upstanding people.  The Taliban took power and really were just fucking awful, and if you didn't follow their rules, they'd just kill you.  Saddam was a tyrant who had no problems killing dissenters, enemies, or friends alike.  His children were sociopaths who answered to no one.\n\nHow do you stop people and groups like this?  They are not exactly going to sit down at a table and say \"Okay, we will stop raping women and stoning them to death, forcing men to grow beards, and killing anybody who disagrees with us.\" or \"Why certainly I will stop gassing this ethnic minority whom I hate and can't allow to prosper or face open civil war and challenges to my dictatorial power.\"  That's not going to happen.\n\nThere are always innocent people caught in the middle, no matter where you go, or what conflict you look at.\n\n&gt; Is there any points to the wars we are in right now, other than money for the contractors and equipment providers? War is a major driver of this terrible economic system, and without it, millions of people wouldn't have jobs. It seems that it is kept around solely for the purpose of keeping the economy running.\n\nWell, oil in Iraq is going to start flowing pretty readily here, and by recent estimates they have a fuck ton.  This will eventually be a big economic boon for the country.  Afghanistan is getting something that resembles infrastructure for the first time in how many hundreds of shit ball years?  I mean the country is a pile of shit, but now there's fucking roads and schools for children to go to.  It's a start.  Yeah there's a lot of war profiteering, and it is despicable.  But it's not like we are doing zero good there either.  It's just one of those hand-in-hand situations where it's ugly and beautiful at the same time.\n\n\n\nAnother issue is that you seem to think that most people in military are some kind of blind patriotic zealots...which is about as far from the truth as you can get.  It is a very diverse group of individuals with a myriad of purposes (most of them mercenary in nature, truthfully) for joining and can't really be fit into any singular mindset - aside from the mindset that they have all willfully signed away their constitutional rights to serve in the armed forces, to obey the lawful orders of those appointed over them, and that their obligation may include them giving their health and well being up to and including their lives.

There's a commonly held belief in global politics stemming from Karl Von Clausewitz that \"War is the continuation of Politik by other means\", and by extension, that war (and violence of varying scale) occurs where it is the most viable option for entities to advance their goals.  \n\nThus, peace only occurs in scenarios where War is not a viable option.  \n\nThe only real way to make war not a viable option (and thus guarantee peace) is to maintain a omnipresent threat of imminent doom should violence be put on the table. Right now, yes, there have been episodes of violence worldwide since the second world war, but the sum total of armed conflict from the end of Second World War to now represents a small fraction of what either world war was.  In essence, despite the existence of armed conflict still in the world, we are in a period of relative peace that has been enforced first by US and Soviet power, and since the fall of the soviet union, by US hegemony.  \n\nPut more simply, people have, for the most part, made the decision to actively not be killing each other on extreme scales because there have been international superpowers capable of wiping them off the planet with relatively minimal effort.  To use the NOD phrase, it's Peace Through Power.  \n\nI'm not sure what you think 'peacekeeping' is, but it's not some magical power gained from blue UN helmets.  It's not the humanitarian aid, it's not the good works they do for the communities they visit.  It's not that anything about 'peacekeepers' themselves that engenders any degree of local respect.  Peacekeepers work out of the threat of overwhelming violence potential - people tend not to fuck with peacekeepers, because the response is quick, violent, and incredibly asymmetrical.  It looks nice on the surface, but really, the gun is very much pointed at the heads of the belligerents.  \n\nWhen it comes to the economic point, I think that this is something of a narrow-minded (but popular) view.  Yes, there are a lot of individuals with a lot of money that have a lot to gain by keeping military contracts flowing, but that's something entirely different from actually driving the economy.  Militarism for its own sake is inherently a cost center unless the actions of the military force directly yield economic gain (which hasn't happened for hundreds of years now).  Even in the USA, military spending is only 4.4% of GDP which, while a massive amount, doesn't consist of a driving force for our economy as a whole by any stretch of the imagination.  The numbers simply don't support that the US keeps up militarism for economic purposes. \n\nSo, in summary, being a soldier isn't a pretty job, but it's certainly a necessary one.  Peace exists because there's someone walking around with a very very big, unpleasant stick that wants peace to continue. Occasional extreme and asymmetrical violence is the unpleasant cost of the peaceful world we take for granted.  Freedom isn't free, and it's no less free simply because we've already beaten down the biggest threats out there to it. \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

Perhaps somebody could show me privatised healthcare actually does benefit humanity as a whole, and not just a small percentage. \n\nEDIT: I was asked to link the post that 'changed my view' the most, so here it is. \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2wzag2/cmv_i_believe_universal_healthcare_should_be_a/covh1ws\n\nHere is the post that I awarded a 'delta' quite early on. Admittedly I perhaps could have been more involved in the thread but I was quite literally overwhelmed with the amount of replies, to the point that the same types of responses were pouring through, deeming it almost impossible to identify which further posts would be deserving of another delta. \n\nAlthough my view is not changed in that I still believe as a society we should work towards everybody having 'free' access to basic healthcare, I am now aware of the implications of a 'human right', and how that could have serious adverse effects. \n\nI'm sorry if I was not totally compliant with the rules of the thread, but overall I see it as a success as it made me see things in a different perspective, and perhaps others have learnt from it as much I have.\n\nThank you for all of your replies. \"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does the following counterargument change your mind?: \"Your definition of human rights is off.

The problem is, as you said, why Marriage is so important.  It's really a matter of principle; for thousands of years, \"Marriage\" has been the term to describe the Union of Two people into One.  It's become a representative of pledging oneself to another, and telling the world that you share a love you plan to last forever.  So, to deny Gay people that right is to say that the love and the feelings that they share for one another as \"inferior\", or at least \"different\", from that felt by straight couples.\n\nYou can lambaste the Civil Rights comparison if you wish, OP, but the simple fact of the matter is that by separating relationships into two groups, Marriages and Civil Unions, then you are definitively stating that there is some difference, and that the Union of a Straight Couple should be treated differently than that of a Gay one.\n\nFinally, Marriage, is at the end of the day, a basic right provided to all people (don't confuse it with Matrimony, which is the religious aspect often associated with marriage).

But that is clearly not the case; the NFL has not taken that stance.\n\nGoodell suspended Josh Gordon for one year for marijuana use, which like domestic violence, does not directly affect on-field performance in the way that steroids or something similar would. For that, Gordon was given a full-year suspension. For marijuana use...something that in [recent polls](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163835/tried-marijuana-little-changed-80s.aspx) almost 40% of the US population has admitted to (in actuality, the number is probably much higher). \n\nUnlike Ray Rice's attack on his then-fiancee, Josh Gordon's offense was victimless. The crimes that Ray Rice committed would result in real jail time for the average American, whereas Josh Gordon's \"crime\" wouldn't incur such harsh penalties. \n\nIf the NFL claimed to leave the policing to the authorities, a mere two-game suspension would be enough to make a statement. But given the NFL's policy of handing out pretty substantial suspensions for players who have committed what would in comparison be considered minor transgressions, the two game suspension isn't nearly enough. It sends a message that abusing a human being is less wrong than smoking a little pot. And domestic violence is a serious problem among NFL players that needs to be dealt with.\n\nIf the NFL is going to meddle in its players personal lives, it needs to be consistent with its punishments. The discrepancy between Gordon's and Rice's suspensions is notable and sends a message, intentionally or not.  \n\nIn recent years the NFL has suspended athletes who violate the NFL's substance abuse policies [a minimum of four games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_players_and_coaches_suspended_by_the_NFL#Suspensions_for_violating_the_substance_policies), but when a player viciously attacks another human being Roger Goodell feels a two-game suspension is sufficient. \n\nThe inconsistency that Goodell has shown sends a dangerous message to NFL players, one that could easily be withdrawn with a harsh penalty for Ray Rice's actions. But instead the NFL went easy on him with laughably modest disciplinary action.

In what scenario will disobeying their orders make things better for you?\n\nA police officer could reasonably knock on your door and say \"Open this door.\" Now, you have the right to privacy, and you don't have to open your door to police if they lack a warrant. There may be any reason they are asking you to open the door: To speak with you about a crime in the area (gathering information), to investigate a possible crime in your home (suspicion), or even to invite you to the local police bake sale (community outreach). But you are under no legal obligation in this context to comply. You can tell the police officer to go away (refusal), you can ignore him, or you could open the door (comply).\n\nIf you comply, and you have an illegal substance, weapon, or even something that looks like one in your house visible from the door, the police officer has reasonable cause to search your home-- immediately. Even if the police officer *thinks* he smells an illicit substance, he can search your home. So compliance in this case absolutely has negative consequences that are avoided by refusal. \n\nWhat if you have done nothing wrong/illegal? You should still not comply, and here's why: Are you the only person who has ever been in your home? If not, it is possible that someone other than you has hidden an illegal substance or item in your home. If the police search your home on other grounds, they may find it, landing you in trouble. Yes, your name may be cleared later, but for now you are likely facing a possession charge. \n\nI believe this gives an example of where disobeying a police officer is to your benefit. Now, if the police officer has reasonable suspicion before you open the door, and you refuse, they will get a warrant and search your home anyway. But you always have a right to refuse certain orders from the police, and this is one of them.\n\nOther examples include:\n\n1. [If you aren't driving and police do not suspect you of a crime, you are not required to produce identification upon their request/order.](http://www.flexyourrights.org/faqs/when-can-police-ask-for-id/) If they are investigating a crime nearby and simply want a record of you having been in the area, they don't have the right to require it of you-- and you shouldn't give it to them, as if you do, they wil find you later in the event a witness describes someone who mildly fits your appearance. Or they might look you back up to pin the case on someone instead of leaving it unsolved.\n2. You can refuse to be searched personally. Trumped by suspicion/warrant.\n3. You can refuse to allow a search of your car. Trumped by suspicion/warrant.\n4. You don't have to talk with police, and if they attempt to detain you, you can ask \"am I free to go?\" and if their answer is anything other than \"yes,\" you can ask \"why am I being detained?\" You cna leave if they say you are free to go.\n5. Unfortunately, you don't have the right to challenge police misconduct on the street.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

In many cases people are shot without a single command being issued, let alone followed.\n\n&gt;Even if you don't trust the police, how is disobeying an officer's command a good idea for you personally? In what scenario will disobeying their orders make things better for you?\n\nWhen that command breaks an already existing law -or- could serve to incriminate you.   There are other instances where you have every right to disobey an order by the police, because it is unlawful.  For example a police officer at your door demands you hang up the phone or come to the door to answer some questions.  Both are unlawful orders in absence of exigent circumstances and/or a warrant both are unlawful.  In this case I stand to gain a good deal of money and/or the ability to carry on my conversation or watch Star Trek in peace.\n\n&gt;Even if you firmly believe that every officer wants to murder you, again, how will disobeying their orders make things better? It would just be providing them the justification they are looking for to shoot you.\n\nDisobeying an order is not justification for a shootin.  However if your belief is correct then disobeying an order could make it *more* difficult for them to murder you.\n\n&gt;Even if you think it is your right to disobey police officers (it isn't, it's a crime), how does this make it a good idea for you? Just because you have the right to do it, doesn't make it a good idea.\n\nSure it does.  If you are correct and they are acting unlawfully you able to sue for actual damages along with the civil rights violations.  If you have the right to do something and it is *not a crime* then there should be *no* legal repercussions for doing so.  You are not under the obligation to help the police in any way and by submitting to their commands that is exactly what you are doing.  Their intent is to charge you with a crime, why would you *help* them?\n\n&gt;At the end of the day, what you have is a person that can legally shoot you telling you to do something.\n\nAt the end of the day, what  you have is a person that can legally shoot you to protect their life or the lives of others.  Because someone has a gun is not a valid reason to do what they say without question.  \n\n&gt;This person is telling you to do something; Isn't it always a good idea to do what they are telling you to do?\n\nNot always.  The punishment for disobeying a police officer isn't a shooting.  The fact that they have a gun doesn't make them right or their orders lawful.

Therefore parenthood is *not* equivalent to pet ownership - even from a purely \"public good\" perspective. It therefore benefits society as a whole to incentivize parenthood (to a point) in a way that pet ownership cannot match. \n\nThe public will benefit from children (in the aggregate). It will not benefit from dogs (in the aggregate) in anywhere near the same way. Therefore, as an incentive for parenthood, we need to accommodate parents/kids in a way that we *don't* need to accommodate pet owners. (And before you bring up overpopulation, note that the US and many other developed nations currently have a birth rate [below replacement levels](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html) - we're maintaining population because of immigration, not because we're having so many babies.)\n\nFinally, another point (which someone already brought up, but which they did not emphasize and which you ignored completely) - **you can't leave a child alone at home** the way you can a dog. Not until they're [*12 years old*](http://lifehacker.com/the-age-kids-have-to-be-before-you-can-legally-leave-th-1652321850) in some states. So having child-free restaurants is a *much* bigger burden on parents than a dog-free restaurant is for dog owners. At the very least you have to pay a babysitter, which is expensive and which some people aren't comfortable with. Meanwhile, Fluffy can easily stay at home alone for 3 hours with zero harm to them and zero chance of having them taken away for neglect. This is a **huge** distinction for parents, even if it's something that may not occur to you if you don't have kids of your own.\n\n[Edit] I just want to add - there are some restaurants (and other venues) where you really shouldn't bring your kids, either. Yes, it's a pain in the ass, but that's life as a parent (and I say this *as* a parent). There's a different expectation in Delmonico's than in Olive Garden - although that goes both ways, of course.\n\n[Edit 2] Wow, thank you for the gold!! :)\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

You are removing your weight from behind your views and making that apathy and opposing views that much stronger by comparison.\n\nYou know what you could do instead? Work with an existing organization or start a new one. The PACs cut in all directions and your feelings are surprisingly common. The only thing you have to do is give people an easy way to express those feelings. A little bit of organization, a clear direction and pressure on a couple of issues at a time and you will see results. It happens all the time on state and local levels. It's just much harder to see nationally because America is kind of huge and it take a lot of pressure to budge, and it takes a lot of organization to get that pressure all pointed in the right direction at the right targets to make change happen.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

This is usually what happens to these people who devote their entire lives to AA meetings and then all of a sudden stop. I've known people who are in AA. Someone in particular who has been going to meetings for 20 years once downright told me if she stopped, then she would go into a downhill spiral of abuse. The program to me seems that it strips away your will and makes people rely on dependence of being addicted to this program instead of alcohol. The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. This on one hand can be a great environment and a very welcoming community that some people need.

One of the main tenets of any 12-step program is the need for character change. I find the program, at times, to rely heavily on semantics, and I don't live my life by all their rules. I have, however, found a lot of help and wisdom and insight from the people in the rooms. There was an episode of Elementary where he says something like (I'm paraphrasing), \"I don't mistake the ethos of the program for a guide to living\". \n\n&gt;The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. \n\nAs a recovering alcoholic, I feel that you are grossly misinformed with this line. This isn't true. The urges, for me, and I can *only* speak for me, subsided greatly over time. I don't wake up thinking about drinking anymore. Some days, I don't think about it at all. Most days, actually. And when I do, like right now, I can remove myself emotionally from wanting a drink. I don't want one. It all comes down to choice. I've seen the phrase will-power in this thread, and it leads me to believe that people don't have a clear understanding of the AA Program. It clearly states, and I agree, that willpower will not work for the addict. I had to get to a point where I didn't WANT to drink, just like I no longer want to smoke. It's not me depriving myself of something I want. It's me living a better, cleaner, happier, healthier life. \n\n&gt;Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program.\n\nI see these people all the time. And, in my mind, they're not doing it \"right\". I don't feel helpless without the program and I don't feel like I lack control *TODAY*.

I can only say that once I start drinking, I'm damn near powerless stop. BUT, and this is where I disagree with the program, at least semantically, only I can have the power to not drink. I make that call. No one holds a gun to my head and forces me to drink. It's my choice. It ALL comes down to choice for me. \n\nI'm a non-Christian and, I'm not gonna lie, some meetings get really god-heavy. But I've come to realize that I don't know everything, and that a Higher Power can simply mean something bigger than me. When I went to rehab, angry and bitter and knowing everything, I made a friend who was a pretty hardcore Christian. She knew I didn't believe in god, and on our last day she made me a card that said \"It's important to believe in something bigger than us\". And on the inside there was a picture of an elephant and it read \"I believe in elephants\". That was my jumping-off point. \n\nThe mind of an addict is tricky and twisted. AA, and other programs, give the addict the ability to sort that shit out in a safe, welcoming environment. Did I work all the steps? No. And I don't know if I ever will. But I learned coping mechanisms and insights into myself and the world around me that have allowed me to keep feeding the good wolf, as they say. There are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy sessions and tools that also work. But we can't put everyone in a box. AA works for someone who wants it work. Who embraces that it does come down to choice. I can't say AA is the only thing that's kept me sober. But it's helped a lot. \n\nSorry for the wall of text - my first post in this subreddit. I hope I'm doing it right. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to address OP's question about \"solution\" to addiction. In my mind, and the mind of many addicts, there is no cure.

Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. This on one hand can be a great environment and a very welcoming community that some people need.

The sum of all the investments that people ever made in a company are what made it possible for that company to operate.  Profitable companies provide customers goods or services that the customers judge to be a better value than any alternative that those customers have -- whether that's because of better quality or lower price or more convenience or whatever.  Customers' lives are made better off, so they pay for products.  If those customers are willing to pay more than it cost to make the product, the company will be profitable, because wealth has been created!  The world has more valuable stuff in it than it had before the investments were made.  The people who lent the money that made that wealth creation possible get a share of the wealth back.  When somebody invests in a profitable company, it's NOT a zero sum game -- on average, the world is better off, or at least that's what the customers said when they voted with their wallets.\n\n\nThe similarity is that both betting and investing are risky.

It probably takes more athleticism to run a competitive marathon time or endure an MMA fight. I will say that I can't immediately think of a more strategic sport than football (more on that in a bit). Though football isn't the greatest in all three categories, it requires a great deal of each.\n\nSkill is probably the weakest of the three criteria for football, but football is unique in the number and variety of skills required to make a football team function; each position has to do things the others don't. Quarterbacks have to be able to assess the movements of the other 21 players all at once and hit a small, rapidly moving target. Receivers have to catch a ball while running at full tilt with less than a second to get a visual lock. Linemen use a type of wrestling technique to clear the way for running backs (or shut down running backs/attack the quarterback in the case of the defensive line.) Kickers and punters have to kick with considerable precision over great distances. Defenders have to take down 200 pound men running full speed without committing a foul; this requires technique and precision, not just strength. I don't think there are many other sports where the roles/skills of each position are as distinct. \n\nWhile it's true that play stops and starts frequently, every second of active play is done at full intensity. There's never a period reserving energy or waiting for a situation to develop or waiting for the action to come back to the other side of the field (The only time play slows down is in the late stages of the game when one team has a substantial lead). Linemen have to wrestle 300 pound men with all their might for the entire game. Offensive players have to run at full speed every play while enduring repeated physical trauma. Defenders also have to run at full speed and exert enough strength to knock down other players doing the same. I think football could almost be likened to high-intensity interval training with the added twist of getting knocked to the ground repeatedly by large men. This requires a great deal of athleticism and endurance.\n\nWhere football especially shines is strategy. Each play requires all 22 players on the field to carry out a very specific action. Players have to memorize a playbook with dozens to hundreds of plays and be able to execute these actions perfectly from memory. If even one or two players of the 11 on a side fails to carry out the play correctly, the play will likely fall apart. Each play is carefully selected based on a great deal of factors, including the strengths and weaknesses of the 22 players on the field, the position of the ball on the field, whether or not the clock is moving, how much time is left, the score and how many downs are remaining. But what's especially unique is that coaches have to predict what the other team will do and outwit them. Football is the only sport where players spend as much time on the intellectual aspects of the game (learning strategy and studying other teams' strategies) as they do developing skills and conditioning their bodies. Football is an 11-on-11, three-hour chess match. No other sport has strategy that involves that level of detail.\n\nI invite you to change my view by demonstrating that another sport requires a great deal of all three criteria, and the sum of that sport is greater than that of American football.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Chess has a ton of strategic depth, that doesn't mean that chess novices display any appreciable amount of strategy.\n\n\nI think skill is the most difficult to quantify, but what I will say is that boxing, unlike football requires a wide variety of skills, footwork, form, endurance, strength, etc, while football players are more specialized.\n\nI think that this shows that even if American football has slightly more skill, the lack of strategic depth and lower athleticism make boxing a far superior sport based on the criteria you've given.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a person who has the following mindset: \"(I chose these criteria since other elements of \"greatness\" like history, excitement level, fun, culture of the fan base, universality, are much harder to quantify.)\n\nEDIT: To further clarify, these criteria were chosen because they are fundamental to how the game is played. \n\nWhile I don't think American football is superior to all other sports in all of these criteria individually, the sum of the skill, athleticism and strategy required in American football makes it great.\n\nFor example, it probably takes more skill to hit a 90 mph fastball or complete a gymnastics routine than to play football. It probably takes more athleticism to run a competitive marathon time or endure an MMA fight. I will say that I can't immediately think of a more strategic sport than football (more on that in a bit). Though football isn't the greatest in all three categories, it requires a great deal of each.\n\nSkill is probably the weakest of the three criteria for football, but football is unique in the number and variety of skills required to make a football team function; each position has to do things the others don't. Quarterbacks have to be able to assess the movements of the other 21 players all at once and hit a small, rapidly moving target. Receivers have to catch a ball while running at full tilt with less than a second to get a visual lock. Linemen use a type of wrestling technique to clear the way for running backs (or shut down running backs/attack the quarterback in the case of the defensive line.) Kickers and punters have to kick with considerable precision over great distances. Defenders have to take down 200 pound men running full speed without committing a foul; this requires technique and precision, not just strength. I don't think there are many other sports where the roles/skills of each position are as distinct. \n\nWhile it's true that play stops and starts frequently, every second of active play is done at full intensity. There's never a period reserving energy or waiting for a situation to develop or waiting for the action to come back to the other side of the field (The only time play slows down is in the late stages of the game when one team has a substantial lead). Linemen have to wrestle 300 pound men with all their might for the entire game. Offensive players have to run at full speed every play while enduring repeated physical trauma. Defenders also have to run at full speed and exert enough strength to knock down other players doing the same. I think football could almost be likened to high-intensity interval training with the added twist of getting knocked to the ground repeatedly by large men. This requires a great deal of athleticism and endurance.\n\nWhere football especially shines is strategy. Each play requires all 22 players on the field to carry out a very specific action. Players have to memorize a playbook with dozens to hundreds of plays and be able to execute these actions perfectly from memory. If even one or two players of the 11 on a side fails to carry out the play correctly, the play will likely fall apart. Each play is carefully selected based on a great deal of factors, including the strengths and weaknesses of the 22 players on the field, the position of the ball on the field, whether or not the clock is moving, how much time is left, the score and how many downs are remaining. But what's especially unique is that coaches have to predict what the other team will do and outwit them. Football is the only sport where players spend as much time on the intellectual aspects of the game (learning strategy and studying other teams' strategies) as they do developing skills and conditioning their bodies. Football is an 11-on-11, three-hour chess match. No other sport has strategy that involves that level of detail.\n\nI invite you to change my view by demonstrating that another sport requires a great deal of all three criteria, and the sum of that sport is greater than that of American football.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Thoughts often follow feelings, not the other way around. Given your history of abuse, it makes sense for you to conceptualize women this way, rationalizing their behavior in a way that explains your experiences and observations. Believing the women in your life now love you for you, and not your money, is a huge risk on your part. It is also the opposite of what you've experienced. To believe you are valuable for who you are and not your money only to have that proven wrong and be rejected for who you are, would be very traumatic. That is also exactly what it sounds like you experienced as a child. You were perhaps taught that who you are is worthless to women.\n\nFor you, material success sounds like your only source of worth because it's the only thing you can think of that would explain your experiences. You may feel worthless and unlovable without it. Considering the only time in your life women have treated you well is after you acquired money, the fear of losing your wealth means losing their love. Losing your source of worth means returning to the abuse(and perhaps a sense of worthlessness). If the only thing you can see that changed between then and now is your wealth, it's easy to understand how you made the connection between love and financial success/utility. And quite frankly, it makes it immensely valuable to you because it's your only perceived means of feeling loved, so your fear of losing it is justified.\n\nHowever, your perception of the world is shaped by your unique experiences and it is **not universally accurate**. No one's is. It is a means to conceptualize and understand what you've personally experienced and adapt you for your specific environment, it serves that purpose. It's not a means of finding truth.

I get it if everything in you is trying to protect you from re-living those traumas from your past by maintaining this view of the world.

Does putting in that extra hard work even make a difference, is it even worth doing?  \"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does the following counterargument change your mind?: \"First off, I'd like to ask you a few questions. When's your birthday (the month), what city do you live in (population size), your race and the race of those who you are seeing get faster times than you. \n\nI start with those questions because there a specific phenomena that we know that are associated with those variables and athletic performance.\n\nThe first being the [Relative Age Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect). Basically what happens in this effect is the individuals born in the early months of a registration season are relatively older than those born in the later months. When this happens at a young age people mistake \"talent\" for just a child being older. Ex: An 8 year old born in January is relatively older than and 8 year old born in December. Then these children get more opportunities and better training because they are perceived as better. So what starts as just a difference in age, becomes a difference in training, which becomes a difference in performance.\n\nThe second effect is the Relative Birthplace Effect. Similar to the relative age effect, children who are born in basically more average or middle population cities have a statistically significant higher performance. This is because there are ample opportunities available to them in these cities, AND they can be noticed for their talent and not be overlooked by others. Contrast this with with small cities where you may not have the opportunities or big cities where you might be overlooked for other skilled individuals and they might receive better training. \n\nThe next effect occurs with stereotypes. Basically if one is told that a certain race or sex is better at something genetically, then the person who is supposedly worse will perform worse than if they did not have the knowledge that the other race or sex was better. Essentially if I was have you run a race and you had no prior knowledge that kenyan's were supposedly really good endurance runners, you would perform better than if I had you run a race against kenyan's and told you that they are better runners than you because of genetics.\n\nAll three of these things are effects that have been proven time and time again, and they contribute to an athletes performance. \n\nMoving on. Now, you mentioned the Kenyan runners. They are interesting aren't they, but have you looked closer at them? Kenya is relatively poor and to travel between any place they run. That's right they run all the time, they also run barefoot, and in order to get out of poverty they often work very had to become amazing runners to get money. In fact they have have entire schools dedicated to training these runners. \n\nNow what does barefoot have to do with anything you might ask? Well as it turns out using shoes has hindered our running ability. It is change our running technique and decreased efficiency, so it is very possible that because of how kenyan's run makes them better, not their genes. \n\nNow what does there culture have to do with their running ability you might ask? Well let's look at the [Boston marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_winners_of_the_Boston_Marathon). Look from 1990 onwards. Absolutely dominated by kenyan's right? Well there is also a few Ethiopians in there as well. Ethiopia and Kenya are notorious for pumping out incredible endurance runners, and they border each other, how about that. So at this point you're probably thinking \"well that makes sense, they are so close they have similar genes, and that's why they run so fast.\" Well actually the opposite, those two countries contain people who's genes are MORE genetically diverse than ANY two white people on the planet. This is because human civilization started in africa, so the further you go from africa the less genetically diverse each population becomes. \n\nWhat I'm trying to point out to you here is that Kenyan's are such good runners, at least now, because of their culture, not their genes.\n\nLet's use another example, Canada. Canadians dominate at hockey. Does that mean Canadians are better genetically to play hockey, or is it perhaps because it's the biggest sport that is played up there. You can do it with pretty much any sport, if any one country dominates in any sport, their country places a huge emphasis on that sport. \n\nAnyway this has gotten long enough, there's more that I could say if you remain unconvinced, but I'll leave it at that for now. What I what to emphasize though is that, genetics, if it does play a role it is very minimal, and any differences you see are probably based on other reasons, a few cited above. Further based on all my education thus far I view genetics in sort of a roleplaying game fashion. Your genetics are your starting traits (high intellect, low strength etc.), but through leveling your character (or training), you can change your traits to be whatever you want them to be. \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

I'm Grim, and here's your chance to tell me why I'm an idiot and yadda yadda yadda. Here's the deal: I'm a 22 year old White Male living in the state of Indiana in the United States of America. My first presidential election was in 2008, and I voted for Obama. I'd already written off the Republicans as the slaves of corporate lobbyists, private interests, and Christian Fundamentalism, and I still believe there's not a single republican worth my support in any way, shape, or form. I was one of those idealistic, optimistic young voters who honestly believed in the power of Democracy. I bought Obama's (false)Hope hook, line, and sinker, and aside from that, I didn't see any alternatives to him that were even remotely palatable. Romney and Santorum were both about as Crazy fundy as presidential candidates got, and Gingrich had Wallstreet so far up his ass that putting him in office would've been, in my opinion, only slightly less worse of an idea than electing Adolf Hitler.\n\nSo here I was: One vote to cast, only one option that seemed viable. I put my faith, my trust, my hope in Obama, and he fucked me. He fucked all of us. Gitmo is still open. The wars in the Middle East are still on. In some states, homosexuals still have to be afraid of being true to themselves. The rich keep getting richer, and those of us below the poverty line just keep sinking deeper and deeper into the mud. In short, I realize now that voting for Obama was a waste of my time and energy, and a huge blow to my ability to trust the American Political System.\n\nSo what do I believe in? Well, I like to keep it simple: I believe in an end to the Drug War, because it's been a complete and utter failure and a waste of everyone's time, energy, and money. I believe in an end to our participation in the Middle East conflicts, because again, we have achieved nothing: One dead dictator, thousands of dead civilians, a \"secret\" prison full of accused terrorists, who if they weren't terrorists going in, I could hardly blame them for being terrorists if/when they get out. Our soldiers deserve causes worth fighting for: Not Imperial Conquest and certainly not a war that does nothing but line the pockets of the Military Industrial Complex.\n\nI believe in reasonable restrictions on gun ownership, but never an outright ban on handguns, shotguns, rifles, etc. I believe that it's not the government's business, nor anyone elses', who you love and who you marry. I believe in the complete and utter separation of church and state. I believe that, if corporations and business aren't going to pay their employees a fair wage, then a minimum wage (That's a whole other CMV) must be set that is enough for people to get by on without having to resort to working three jobs. if McDonalds can triple the pay of their CEO to 13.8 million dollars, then I can call bullshit on a raise in the Minimum Wage destroying the economy!\n\nI believe that education is a universal right for all humans, and it shouldn't be denied to someone just because they can't afford it. I believe that Climate Change being caused by humanity's rising consumption of fossil fuels, and I want to see the government take an active role in shifting us away from their use, while funding and supporting alternative energies. I believe in spending our budget responsibly, and working to make a better country in the long term, so that it's a country I'd actually want to start a family in.\n\nI don't like either party. Neither of them are anywhere near my stance in politics, and I don't know where to begin looking for alternatives, if they even exist. I'm sick of watching the American People elect morons and greedy, self serving jack-nozzles, and I can't allow myself to be a part of that endless circlejerk anymore.\n\nSo here's the TL;DR: Given the disgustingly revolting state of the American Political Scene, should I even bother voting? If so, then provide me with some pointers for where to look for good candidates. I'm looking for parties outside of the ludicrous \"Red vs Blue\" Spectrum. I still want to believe that the system can work. So help it prove itself to me.\n\nEDIT: Climate Change bit, I believe it's man made. Also, stop reminding me how little power the president has. I'm using that election as an example because the 2008 was my very first federal Election, and Barack Obama's deceit and betrayal had a profound impact on my attitude in regards to American Politics.

And this arguably had a major effect on the minimum wage campaign that was successful there recently.  Regardless of what you think of minimum wage, this is a pretty good example where elections were effectively used to counter the two-party system.  \n\nAnother example is in the city of Richmond, California, which hosts Chevron's biggest oil refinery.  People in the city have long suffered some pretty bad environmental externalities form the plant, but City Council has always been on the side of Chevron due to kickbacks and whatnot.  However, [over the past ten years ordinary people organized](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/chevron-hits-rough-patch-in-richmond-calif.html) and now the Council is evenly split between people on Chevron's payroll, and people who are anti-Chevron and want better environmental protections.

Business people don't study anything that will help society advance in these ways. But that's not really what a business degree is for.\n\nA business degree has much more in common with a trade school than a degree in physics or medicine. A business degree isn't really even an academic subject as much as learning a white collar trade.\n\nThe actual *study* of business won't help society. It won't really help anyone other than the student, assuming that the degree will help them land a job. However, what they do with that degree could help society immensely, and we, as a society, would be totally fucked without them.\n\nLet's take a scientist for example. The scientist would be useless if he didn't have his lab. His lab would be useless if it didn't have power, equipment, lab assistants, running water, and supplies. Labs, in short, are very, *very* fucking expensive. So for the scientist to do his work, he needs bookkeepers to pay the bills, he needs the finance guys to secure capital, he needs the business analysts to keep processes efficient and cost effective, he needs the CFO to map out a sound financial strategy, he needs HR to screen applicants, he needs operations to keep the building in good shape, he needs marketing to generate revenue to pay for the next project, and on and on and on and on.\n\nAll of the useful things that doctors, scientist, and engineers accomplish depend on competent businessmen and women to keep all of the peripheral stuff up and running. Without all of those business students, all of the useful professions wouldn't be able to do much of anything, and they would waste huge amounts of time sorting through bills and trying to budget (things that they're probably not particularly good at) instead of playing to their strengths.\n\nTo create these competent business people that will help us achieve new and amazing things in science, engineering, and pretty much every other field, we need people to learn the business trades. So in that sense, the study of business is hugely helpful to our society, because without them we wouldn't even be able to keep the lights on.\n\n**TL;DR** Scientist can't science if we don't keep their institutions up and running, and the study of business is, essentially, the study of keeping institutions up and running. \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

Some of them come from other comments, but I think it's worth collecting them all together and expanding on them, to make it clear exactly how many there are.\n\n* Regular wings are more versatile, and can cater to a larger number of preferences - boneless wings can only be served breaded because they're absolutely terrible otherwise. \n\n* Regular wings have a crispy fried layer of skin on the outside.  This is universally recognized as delicious, and is impossible to achieve on boneless wings.\n* Regular wings are made of darker meat, which is more flavourful and higher in fat.\n* If you select your wings for the health benefits, you're doing it wrong.\n* Regular wings are more consistent in quality - if I order a boneless wing, it could be a nice, fleshy (but still tasteless) piece of chicken breast, or it could be a blob of mechanically separated meat, mixed with fillers and coated in way too much batter (which is why they're cheaper, by the way.)  If I buy regular wings, I'm getting wings.  The worst that could happen is they're slightly smaller than usual, which can still happen with boneless, especially considering the amount of breading they often come packed with.  \n* Chicken, like most meat, is priced per pound.  This means that, even in the best-case scenario of large, meaty boneless wings, you aren't getting cheaper chicken based on the shape it's pressed into - but rather, based on the quality of the meat.\n* Bone-in cooking allows for more tenderness.  Boneless wings are either [a.] not as tender, or [b.] packed with fillers to help change the texture.\n* Why should you try to forget that you're eating an animal when you are, in fact, eating an animal?  If you think there's some sort of moral dilemma (which presumably is why you're having existential crises,) you owe it to yourself to face up to it, rather than avoiding having bones in your food.  This is for the same reason that any other morally-grey issue doesn't magically become better if you close your eyes and pretend it isn't happening.\n* There are ways of easily eating the chicken off the wing without expending very much effort.  Yes, it's still slightly easier to just bite into a boneless wing, I'll give you that one, but the difference is quite minimal - especially compared to all the benefits I've listed above.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

To me, this divides into two categories, (1) inability for you to prevent the government from taking a non-physical right (tracking you through the internet, attacking you with a drone, charging a tax that is an infringement of your rights, not letting you obtain a marriage license, preventing you from voting) and (2) arming yourself with a gun and fight for some physical space. \n\nFor the first point, there are many, many rights that can be taken away and whether or not you have a gun is irrelevant. Abortion could be outlawed tomorrow. I cannot marry a woman. The government is collecting data about me to a degree that's not known. I have to file income taxes. I will have to pay taxes to one day inherit my parent's money. I cannot build any building I want on my own property. My driver's license can be taken away from me. These are not all examples of rights I feel I deserve or want but they are examples of rights where having a gun cannot help me.\n\nNow, for the second point. I simply can't envision a situation where a group of people with guns is able to overpower a police force, the National Guard, a State Militia, or the US Military. So I don't see any situation where people could prevent the government from being in a space and controlling it for a sustainable time period.\n\nPlease, CMV. I have not been able to think of any counter examples to these arguments.\n\nEdit: My view has been changed. I think the main problem with my view was I saw this as a plausibility question, not a possibility question. It's not likely that this will happen in the us in my lifetime, but that does not mean it is not possible. This is also the reason I didn't consider comparisons between places like Syria, Iraq, or Vietnam with today's US because the differences are so obvious and the political troubles are on an entirely different level.

So if a foreign power decided to invade and, in some way, was able to cripple our military (even temporarily), the people would still be able to defend themselves because they would be armed.

There are certainly tons of flaws with it.\n\nSecond, I will say that I used to agree that teachers should be paid based on performance. Since, I have become more involved with non-traditional route teaching (so, I am becoming more familiar with the system, but I wouldn't gain anything by maintaining the status quo), I've since changed my mind on that fact almost completely. This is the part that I will mostly address.\n\nThere are a few main problems with this.\n\n1. \"Performance\" is a tricky word. When we talk about \"teacher performance\" in this context, we are rarely ever talking about a teacher's actual performance (dedication, preparation, knowledge, ability to keep students interest), and instead we are almost always actually talking about *student* performance, particularly grades. As you will see in #2, a student's performance is not *always* indicative of the teacher's.\n\n2. If you are indeed talking mostly about student performance (which I believe you are, particularly since you mentioned third-party test grading), my question for you is: have you ever gotten a good grade in a class you put very little effort in/a bad grade in a class you put a lot of effort in? If not, surely you know people who have. This *might* be mitigated by standardized tests, but standardized tests can be awful for a lot of reasons. I'll give you a real-world example: My old high school hired on a *terrible* Spanish teacher (she taught Spanish II) that didn't actually teach students... anything. So, students came in with some background in Spanish, spent a year learning absolutely nothing, and then got to Spanish III (where the teacher was actually pretty good, I had her myself), where... they knew nothing. If the year-end tests were created by the teacher in question, then perhaps her students would pass, moving on to Spanish III... where the good Spanish teacher would be punished for the bad Spanish teacher's performance (or, at least she would have to lower her standards). More likely, in your system, the tests would not be made up by the teacher. In this case, the students would fail the class, potentially be unable to graduate (and/or get into a good college) entirely because of the teacher. Now, this teacher would eventually be removed from the system, but this would still produce about 2-3 generations of students fucked over by the system every time you have a bad teacher.\n\n3. To me, the above says, well, maybe we shouldn't have the tests decide whether or not kids pass the class, but rather just have them as markers of teacher performance. This is a *better* idea, but wouldn't solve the issue of the Spanish III teacher taking the fall for the Spanish II teacher's shortcomings. Students would then be unable to pass Spanish III tests because that teacher would have to teach Spanish II &amp; III in one year to prepare them. \n\n4. Beyond this all, this system is biased against those of lower socioeconomic status, who are shown to perform worse on standardized tests. I won't spend any time defending that, but if you're interested, you should look into it. But, imagine this: you are looking for a job, and one of your options is somewhere that the work will be *much* harder, you're almost guaranteed to get paid less, *and* you'll be blamed for all of it. Meanwhile, you can go work at a so-called \"nicer\" school, work less, get paid more, and everyone will praise you for your hard work. This is sort of the current system anyway, but your suggestion exacerbates it. So-called \"bad\" areas already struggle to keep teachers around, so this just funnels more funds into \"good\" schools while choking out \"bad\" schools... which leads to \"bad\" areas being even less capable of receiving \"good\" education.\n\n5. This is not really a point directly against your argument, but rather just a general statement about the sort of solution you're proposing. Education is definitely crucial to any nation's health, which is why it's constantly under fire in the US. However, everyone trying to \"fix\" the schools has never had any experience teaching! People are trying to fix something while only knowing the symptoms, and none of the problems.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

Thus, it shouldn't be fair for teachers to be judged on test scores since these mentally-challenged (apologies if I sound offensive) students cannot perform on par with students of normal cognitive abilities.\n\nYou have to take into account that many high schools offer Honors classes that separate the more motivated students (and/or better test-takers from those who would preform worse on standardized tests. It wouldn't be fair to the teacher of a standard class to be compared with the teacher of an honors class since the teacher of an honors class will get the better students (e.g. the students who would actually care to do well on tests) and not the students who don't give a damn (which is an inevitable result of mandating school attendance).\n\nFinally, if the students do well, how can you determine whether or not they did so because of the teacher or because they self-studied?

Networking can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but certainly no one is defending outright nepotism (let's just give the job to my cousin because reasons). The details of the hiring process also can vary heavily by industry. Some things I want to point out:\n\nHiring can be extremely expensive. If via the \"standard process\", a company gets a thousand applications for an open position, with many if not most of the candidates being total garbage, going through this volume of resumes can be a herculean task. Given the inputs (thousands of applicants) and the desired outputs (hire one person), its awfully hard for me to imagine a paradigm where you're not allowed to short-list a candidate who you have good reason to believe is a strong candidate. Whatever benefits to social mobility you think such a hypothetical paradigm shift would bring, I hope you at least acknowledge what a massive burden this would be.\n\nI think you also need to acknowledge how subtle \"networking\" can be. Certain forms seem benign to the point of it being absurd to try to regulate them. At any given point, there's a pool of applicants and a pool of jobs. But not all applicants can apply to every job, and sometimes potential applicants may not even be looking. Also, not only are some applicants bad fits for certain jobs, but some jobs are bad fits for certain applicants. Even if \"networking\" is just the employer telling the applicant about the *existence* of a job opening that they think would be a good fit has huge effects, without any kind of \"short list\" stuff (although at this point if they stop there, the company is probably knowingly wasting a ton of time and money with their  \"weed out\" process on a candidate that they already are pretty sure will at least get an interview). Are you advocating that even this level of networking be discouraged?\n\nLastly, I'm skeptical that \"reducing networking\" will necessarily even help your goals. Although you talk about the cliche schmoozing at networking events style stuff, in my experience real world networking is one of the purest forms of meritocracies out there, as its based very directly on real world performance. But when you fall back to any kind of \"standard process\", I think you underestimate the extent to which such systems can be in a sense \"gamed\" by having the \"right\" sort of resume. And like networking, understanding how the \"standard\" process works and can be manipulated is a skill that is going to be disproportionately found in upper class applicants. Meanwhile now you're *removing* an avenue by which less advantaged applicants who have already proven themselves and built professional relationships to stand out as the excellent applicants they are.\n\ntl;dr - Hiring is really hard. Even very subtle and benign forms of networking can have major positive benefits for both employer and applicant. Forcing all applicants through a \"standard process\" might make the problem you're trying to solve worse, not better.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

There are quite a few examples in the song which do not seem ironic at all, in my opinion: \n\n\n\n*An old man turned ninety-eight/\nHe won the lottery and died the next day*: Winning the lottery does not carry the expectation of directly increasing your lifespan; the action and result are not related. Moreover the man was quite old already, so it is not an unexpected outcome that he died.\n\n\n\n\n*It's a black fly in your Chardonnay*: This situation might be unexpected, but it is not ironic. There is no direct expectation that there will never be a fly in your drink.  The issue of flies in a drink is generally not a conscious concern for people drinking alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n*It's like rain on your wedding day*: Your explanation for this line was that it was an example of situational irony, because women tend to \"plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control.\" However, I think you are reading too much into this solitary verse.  Morisette does not mention a woman (instead using *your*), or that the wedding had been planned explicitly on a day with the intent of avoiding bad weather. The intent of this lyric seems to be of giving an example of an unfortunate event, which is not the definition of irony.\n\n\n\n\n*It's a free ride when you've already paid*: You have conceded that this does not seem ironic, and I agree.\n\n\n\n\n*It\u2019s the good advice that you just didn\u2019t take*: To quote one of your other posts, \"I agree that this one line is not ironic\".\n\n\n----------------------------\n\n\n\nI also disagree that the plane crash is ironic, since not enough information is given on Mr. Play It Safe's expectations of the flight. After all, you can still do an action while being afraid that something will go horribly wrong. For example, a construction worker may be afraid of falling off a roof, but still proceeds to work in such a situation. Since the man's expectations of boarding the plane are never elaborated on, we are left to speculate whether or not he expected the plane to crash, ergo we cannot conclusively say whether or not it is situational irony. However, judging from your responses, I do not think you will find this line of reasoning convincing. I do agree, however, that the man's quip is a perfect example of verbal irony.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also disagree that the song is trying to allude to cosmic irony. From my understanding, the concept of cosmic irony is tied to a belief that some type of external force, either gods or fate, is actively trying to sabotage your plans. I found a good quote [here](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-cosmic-irony.htm) when I was searching for additional definitions of cosmic irony: \n\n\n\"Although cosmic irony can also often be termed as coincidence or bad luck, not all coincidences are cosmic irony. It deals only in those coincidences where the action or event is assumed by the person taking the action to have a positive outcome when the actual outcome results in a detrimental consequence to that person. Unlike other forms of irony, where someone else is responsible for the twist in circumstance or the misconception of a good result, in cosmic irony it is **an unknown force, such as fate or the universe**, that seems to be working against the person.\" \n\n\n\n\nA perfect example of this comes from the story of *Oedipus*, where a prophecy is made about the titular character that he will kill his father and marry his mother. In attempt to avoid this, his parents order him killed, since they cannot bear doing it themselves. The expectation of stopping the prophecy is reversed when Oedipus survives and then proceeds to fulfill the prophecy precisely because his parents attempted to subvert it. The takeaway of the story was supposed to be that no mortal could subvert the will of the Gods. None of these elements are alluded to in the song. There is no mention of the universe, Fate, any type of malicious God, or other interfering agent. This is the crucial element required for a situation to be cosmic irony, rather than simply being unfortunate or tragic. I simply do not see enough allusion to this concept in the song to be able to claim the artist intended to invoke this trope.\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, we both agreed that Morisette included examples of situations which are not ironic at all. Given this, plus the fact that she conceded that she \"did not understand irony that well\", what is a more reasonable conclusion to reach about the intent of this song:\n\n\n* The artist was attempting some type of subtle, avant-garde approach to talk about instances of irony which most people would not understand. But for whatever reason, she later conceded that she did not understand the meaning of irony.\n* The artist confused the meaning of \"ironic\" with \"unfortunate\" or \"unexpected\", and didn't understand that irony denotes much more than that.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Occam's Razor, I would have to believe in the latter. I hope to hear your thoughts on this.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

The idea is to be comfortable in your own skin and be okay with who you are from a physical appearance standpoint.\n\nCrushing people's self esteem and telling them they're awful beasts for being fat or whatever doesn't encourage a healthy lifestyle. So even *if* rejecting fat shaming and promoting body acceptance does not promote a healthy lifestyle, fat shaming itself also does not promote a healthy lifestyle. It promotes the notion that it's okay to be terrible to people because you feel like it, which has been shown to actually have negative impacts- i.e. it makes people stagnate and keep making poor choices in life instead of encouraging them to better themselves.

I hear \"I am proud of who I am\" and \"I think I am beautiful\" from obese people (myself included) but we're not proud of being *fat*- we're proud of *ourselves as a whole.* Until I moved past self-loathing for being fat and being massively insecure about it, I was unable to make progress to better myself and lead a better lifestyle, for example (and anecdotal evidence.)\n\nThat is not to say that there are not *some* people who are literally proud of being fat.

That certain experiences can never be truly replicated in other mediums.

In other words, when the experience is composed using a medium's essential qualities, it makes sense you can't 100% replicate unless *you have* the medium's essential qualities present.\n\n\nAs an example I'm going to rely on fine arts since the idea is easier to convey. So, like a painting does utilize narrative, but has specific qualities which seperate it from other mediums, [like this painting](http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/van-gogh-wheatfield-1889-granger.jpg) It utilizes the limit of the picture plane to make it's composition and is trying to convey how endless and majestic the field is by allowing it to take up so much space. Brush strokes are used to give a unique experience of whirliness, that is easy to get lost in, and is contrasted by the straightness of adjacent brushstrokes, helping to make the field stand out and feel unique to the rest of the painting. If this whirliness were moving (like in a film), it would change the experience. If it were made into a scultpure, you lose the composition, since it no longer has a picture plane. Their would be no brushstrokes, no vagueness to the characters. You would be able to move around and view it as you please, rather than the stillness the pictures alludes. Likewise, [a sculpture](http://enjoyillinoisblog.com/2010/05/gsu-sculpture-park.jpg) has a physical presence that can never be replicated by a painting. You could feasibly make a painting of this specific scene, but it doesn't necesarrily replicate the experience of seeing it in person; the overwhelming presence of it. Each of these mediums rely on different mechanisms which enable them to convey different experiences. As I see it, it doesn't necessarily make one medium better than the other, but rather makes each one viable as a unique seperate experience. Kind of like arguing that Indian food is superior to Japanese food, so one should never consume Japanese food. But they each convey different experiences, so the more ideal situation would be to enjoy and experience both, even if you happen to favor one. I think the popular way of saying it is \"Apples and Oranges\".\n\nI think certain things are very translatable because they rely purely on plot and character. Other things will tend to rely on how these things interact with the form and medium elements or rely on those entirely (like poetry for example), and as a result become close to untranslatable between mediums. On the Road is a good example of something that is just nigh-impossible to translate due to it's extremely heavy reliance on language-play.\n\n*Edit - removed redundant point\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

How many people say \"OP is a bisexual\"?\n- There still exists a large population of people who think homosexuality is simply a choice or mental defect.\n- (Males predominantly), PDA is extremely frowned upon.\n\nGender difference and social acceptance;\n\n- Let's face it, in America (I'm assuming you're from the US, OP?), females are more likely to be dismissed as \"experimenting\" than anything else.  Males tend to receive a harsher social judgement.  I'm paraphrasing Dan Savage here, but he said something along the lines of \"A girl can kiss 100 other girls and still be curious.  However, if you took the biggest, toughest, baddest dude you know, and he sucks *one* dick...he's labeled as gay forever.\"  Given, Savage said it much better/funnier than me, but there's some truth to it.\n- Bisexual girls tend to be more socially accepted than their male counterparts.  This, in part, is due to the douchey nature of straight men.  I realize there's a whole lot more to it than this, but douchey \"bros\" certainly don't make it better.\n\nLastly, why you might feel the way you do about some of your points;\n\n- I think maybe it's perceived that Bisexuals are more likely to cheat is because of the false notion that having twice the dating pool automatically means you'll take those opportunities.  Honestly, I don't see how this makes it any *harder* to come out as Bi than gay...this point might make it *equally* hard to come out, but certainly not harder.\n- The notion that you can't really be bisexual &amp; that bi women only do it to turn guys on.  To be honest here, this one is a little muddy.  Why?  Because it's certainly the case that, somewhere in the 90s, it somehow became socially \"cool\" or \"edgy\" for a girl to say she's Bi.  Now I'm not saying that you fall into this category, what I'm saying is that **the fakes have spoiled things for the genuine**.  In my *personal* experience (I used to go out to the bars in my younger days), I met a good portion of girls who would go out and say they're bi and drink and make out/fondle other girls all the while having men take phone pics and cheer them on.  None of these girls would ever date another girl, or get intimate with another girl.  They would just say it's alcohol induced girlish fun, and the guys like it (yes, I've been told that before).  It's a sad state that \"Bi\" has become the party girl code for \"I like to get drunk and skank out to be an exhibitionist\", but it's true.  That's not the fault of the genuinely bisexual community.  Again, I don't see how this makes it inherently *harder* for you to come out as bisexual.  I see how it could make it harder for you to be taken seriously, but not harder on you socially. \n\nIn the end, I'm neither gay nor bi (I'm a heterosexual black male), and I say this so that you know something about the stranger on the internet who's dolling out CMV advice.

It's just harder to *stay* out.\n\nMy bi friends who end up in long-term opposite-sex relationships get assumed by their families to have \"settled down\" and be \"straight now\" and so everything worked out alright. Their same-sex exes are also more likely to whine that those relationships were just experiments and they were taken advantage of, but those exes would've been whining about something anyway.\n\nFrankly, most of the reason that gay people have issues with bi people comes down to *jealousy*. A gay person can never, ever be with the one they love without it being obvious that they're gay. A bi person can, since they can fall in love with someone of the opposite sex. They can get married and have kids the natural way. Their dating pool is also nearly 11x as big. A gay person's dating pool is about a 10th of the sex they like, so about 5% of the population. A bi person's dating pool is the 47ish% of the opposite sex that's straight or bi, plus that gay or bi 5% of their own sex.\n\nSo yeah, you're going to have slightly more issues with other gay people than a kinsey 6 would. And that's pointless and stupid and sucks. But on the other hand, you still have the entire world of heterosexuals to choose from. There are gay women out there who won't date bi women, but there's not nearly as many of them as there are straight/bi men who will. I'd consider that more than a fair trade.

I wouldn't date one, and I'm not bi.)\n\nBeing bi also makes being poly a heck of a lot more convenient, if you later decide that's your thing.

The notion of a social construct addresses ideas, whereas I'm pretty sure in comparing it to biology you are thinking of it in terms of behaviors? They're not really the same thing.\n\nFor example when people talk about \"The South\" they tend to forget about how there are like, a lot of african americans. The South is thought about as an [exclusively white place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUFL2GT1-2g), [which doesn't reflect the reality of the situation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama#Race_and_ancestry). But it affects the way people behave toward it and think about it, and that's called a social construct. So even if biology conditions behavior to some extent we can still recognize the way ideas are created and question our assumptions and change the way we behave toward those ideas. You're pretty much granting that at least that much free will is possible by posting in change my view so I'm taking it as a given.\n\nThere's not really any one \"Social construct theory\" so let's talk about something more specific, like [Edward Said's Orientalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)). The gist of it is that other cultures are often oversimplified when represented in the west, and especially as static through time and unsophisticated, with the implicit point that western culture is dynamic and vital. This sort of representation happens even in art, where oriental themes are presented as aesthetically superior but fail to fully engage with the complexity and history of the culture.\n\nSo like, as for contemporary examples maybe think of western otaku--or I guess I got the sense they all died out in 2008 but you know what I mean--who think of Japan in terms of the oversimplified picture they get from manga and anime. Or to address the common stereotype that Japan is a country tolerant of bizarre sexual fetishes; remember the panty vending machine thing? [As it turns out that was a workaround to a law that *banned* pornographic vending machines, which itself wasn't so odd given the popularity of vending machines in Japan](http://www.snopes.com/risque/kinky/panties.asp). And yeah, the panty vending machines were banned too. As it turns out the Japanese aren't like, homogeneously creepy. \n\nThis isn't to say cultural differences aren't real; that would be silly. Only that the way culture is represented--even well meaningly!--is reductive in a way that often smothers critical thought and inflates the egos of the people that made the representation.\n\nAnyway, all of that is just to say that the idea of a social construct isn't bullshit when you know what people mean by the phrase. As for its applicability, let's look at what I'm pretty sure you really mean, or one thing I'm pretty sure you really mean: biologically essential sex differences. Now whether or not those exist at all and to what extent is too big a topic to get into here. But there are enough bad ideas from history that are obviously silly and follow the patterns of a social construct as detailed above that the idea of social constructs explaining many perceived sex differences holds together pretty well. And that should encourage us to be pretty suspicious of our own ideas about gender and sex. After all, everyone else who came before us thought they had gotten it right too.\n\nAnyhow, here's a short-ish list of some of the most relevant ones: \n\n*[Sexual division of labor is intrinsic, and women belong in the home when it has been pointed out time and again that this is mostly a product of the industrial revolution.](http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Division_of_labor.aspx)\n\n*[That women are more likely to make pacts with Satan because they have a voracious sexual appetite.]\n(http://witcombe.sbc.edu/davincicode/witches.html)\n\n*[That women want sex less than men (but wait didn't they just say the opposite? And wait, don't we still believe that?)](http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/turns-out-women-have-really-really-strong-sex-drives-can-men-handle-it/276598/)\n\n*[That women have big asses because god made them for sitting.](http://people.uncw.edu/smithrw/200/WomenQuotes.htm)\n\n*[Basically everything this asshole had to say about it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle's_views_on_women)\n\nYou get the point. Now a lot of people would probably object that these are verifiably false and we know better now--but really we're agreeing here. These conclusions came from reasoning that was *considered* just as valid as science, and so we can't take our assumptions at face value. Which is doubly true when you consider how the scientific method has been blind to prejudice, cf [phrenology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) and [this overview here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politicization_of_science).\n\nAgain, none of that is to say there are *no* sex differences; that's an unsettled question. But biases arise in ways you wouldn't expect, and common claims should be examined critically.\n\nAnd as for the nature vs. nurture debate, if you think it's any closer to being settled than it was in the 18th century I think you should read up on the emerging field of [Epigenetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic)--as it turns out Lamarck wasn't 100% wrong!--and the [Flynn Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect).\n\nHope that helped!\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

If this is true, a given \"social construct\" could only attain widespread prevalence if it appealed to something inherent in the physical makeup of a large group of humans.\n\nFor the sake of argument, I will accept the first statement as factual, and attempt to demonstrate how it does not prove the second the statement. If cultural constructs were largely pre-determined by genetics, it does not explain both the diversity of cultures, or how cultures mix and influence each other. \n\nLooking at isolated cultures, we see some radically different social norms: e.g. what is beautiful or obscene, polyandry and polygamy rather than monogamous relationships, matriarchies or egalitarian societies, concepts of ownership and value, and religious beliefs. As these cultures often change upon extended exposure to other cultures, we cannot assume that these people are *genetically* predisposed to different social constructs, rather that their social constructs were created parallel to we believe to be the norm. \n\nEurope has many countries that have very distinct cultures despite a great deal of cultural interactions, similar genetics, and similar resources and climates. If culture were largely genetically predetermined, these cultures would be far more homogenous. \n\nAdditionally, looking at first generation immigrants versus their parents demonstrates a large difference in how similar genetics can operate very differently in different social constructs. If behavior and values are largely genetically predetermined, then we would see the children of those raised in a different culture holding onto the same social constructs as their parents, while they are far more likely to assimilate and reflect the values of the culture they were raised in.\n\nAs social creatures, part of the human psyche is to express belonging through different social constructs, whether that behavior is oppositional or participatory. While this is a natural urge, it produces cultural constructs that are meant to differentiate rather perfectly reflect natural factors. The origin of social constructs can be said to lie in biology, but their expression requires diversity rather than perfect alignment with hard-wired genetics. \n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

Nothing remains of me after my death even though I leave a carcass. A human body is not sacred or inviolable.\n\nIt's this premise that seems a bit weak.\n\nIt smacks of [Kant's Promise](http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/DB047SECT14); Kant promised the king of Prussia, Frederick William II, that he wouldn't publish any more criticisms of religion. When the king died, Kant resumed his attack on religion. In Kant's view only promises made to people had any normative force, so when the person he made his promise to became a corpse (not a person), Kant considered himself absolved of his moral duty. Most non-Kantians (and many Kantians as well) believe this argument fails. The normative force of promises is derived from the duty to respect the autonomy of the subject of the promise (breaking a promise is a kind of lie, and lying violates autonomy), but how can you say you're respecting a person's autonomy when you fully intend to break your promise to them sometime in the future? This is evidence that the autonomy of once-living persons carries at least some normative force after they are dead.\n\nWe can easily see how this relates to cannibalism; unless you have some good reason to believe a person wants to be cannibalized, based on general attitudes toward cannibalism we can assume a person does not want their body to be cannibalized after they die, and to do so would represent Consensual cannibalism may be morally permissible, however it would be so rare that the only way to effectively regulate it is to criminalize it, and place the burden of proof of consent on any would-be cannibals. The status of cannibalism doesn't change for all practical purposes.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

Nonetheless, there are some pretty important practical issues.\n\nThere are certain rights you get to have when you die, like having a will. If someone figures out what they want to be done when they die in advance, and after they die, this is enforced, it makes things easier. It's only fair that when you own your house, you get to say who gets to have it when you die. Your family doesn't get to decide it for you, because that leads to inheritance squabbles which, depending on the value of the inheritance, can be divisive, or even bloody. You get to make the same call with your body. If you want to donate your organs when you die, you can do that, but if you don't for some reason, like you have a religious objection to it, or you just don't want your family to worry about you getting hacked up and passed out like a Thanksgiving turkey, you're within your rights to not be an organ donor. If you don't want your remains to be preserved when you die because you think that's bad for the environment, that's up to you. If you want to be stuffed and mounted, that's your prerogative. Your wishes aren't sacred, e.g. if you want to be stuffed and mounted but no taxidermist is willing to taxidermize a human, you're out of luck, but in general, it's your body, you're in charge of it for the whole time you're alive, and you should get to say what happens with it when you're done using it.\n\nSomeone eating or having sex with your corpse is also something you should have a say in. Most people are not okay with the idea of someone having sex with their corpse or eating them. A cannibal or necrophiliac can't ask permission from the person whose corpse they are mucking about with, so unless the person explicitly states in their will that they are okay with being eaten, and dictate who is allowed to eat them, the cannibal is violating the person's death rights. If I have a friend who really wants to have sex with my corpse when I die, and I'm okay with that and indicate clearly and explicitly how that is to happen, maybe that should be okay, but it's such an unusual and specific circumstance that it's not really worth the effort it would take to regulate it.\n\nRegarding stem-cell human meat: If the volunteer is willing and informed of the extent to which their genes will be used to produce meat, I'd say it's fair game. However, it wouldn't be safe for human consumption because of kuru, and should therefore never be FDA approved or sold as food. It's not the same as chopping up and eating a cadaver, but it's not a good idea, either.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

Based on the extensive research I've done, I know that chemical engineers with my credentials should make between $90K-110K a year.\n\nI make it through 3 rounds of interviews, and the company offers me the job, and says they'll pay me 75K a year.

The difference between the $75k per year and the minimum of $90k and maximum of $110k is a range between 68% and 83%, which includes the average of 77%. However, the problem with women's inequality in compensation isn't because a job should pay a range of $90k and $110k per year and women are stupidly accepting a mere $75k per year. The problem is that a job pays between $90k and $110k per year, with women occupying the lower end of that $20k spectrum and men occupying the highest.\n\nYour hypothetical is also flawed because it makes it seem as though the appropriate response from a woman confronted with a significantly lower salary (presumably for no other reason than that she is a woman, although your hypothetical doesn't specify if this is the case) than the minimum compensation of what this position should command is to shrug it off and try to find better pay elsewhere. I believe that the appropriate response is that women should not accept discrimination from anyone anywhere for any reason. Activists have won many legal and legislative victories over the years that provide women who are discriminated against recourse and protection. \n\nThere are only two possible reasons why there is a disparity in pay between the sexes. Either individual women are innately stupid and inferior to men, and their collective low pay reflects this, or there is a societal reason for the disparity. If you believe that women not only occupy a lower end of the compensation spectrum, but also the lower end of the intelligence and competency spectrum, then you are by definition, a sexist even if you are yourself a woman.

This has been nice.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does the following counterargument change your mind?: \"Hi, I'd like to change your mind.\n\nFirst, you should know why so many parents end up giving their children bad eating habits. For many poor families, this is simply because they were raised with unhealthy eating habits themselves. They do not see their habits as 'bad' because it was what their parents fed them, and what their grandparents fed their parents, and so forth. \n\nNow, I know what you might be thinking; that is not a good excuse and it is not hard to know what healthy food is. However, that is not true and I will outline why.\n\n1. Food companies know that the poor and uneducated generally do not understand food and nutrition.\n\nHell, even middle class and rich fall for this as well. If you do not believe me, just go down the cereal aisle of wal-mart and look at the boxes. You'll see words on them like \"MADE WITH 100% WHOLE GRAIN!\" or \"NO ADDED SUGAR!\" At a glance, this seems to imply that the food is healthy, when in reality it's just telling the truth with the worst parts hidden in the background.\n\nSomething may be whole grain but that does not mean it is healthy. Something may not have any sugar added, but that doesn't mean there is not any natural sugar in it.\n\nI bring this up because many people will think and believe they are buying food that is healthy, but really they are being tricked. It is easy for someone like me to read the side of the box, check the ingredients, and know what is in there. But a lot of people do not understand those labels and most only go by the calories. I was lucky enough to be raised with parents who taught me how to read those. So, to say these parents who fall prey to these marketing tricks are abusers is really unfair.\n\n2. Junk food is generally cheaper.\n \nI know people like to say that isn't true, that junk food is not cheaper, but that varies by areas. These are called [Food deserts. A food desert is a district with little or no access to large grocery stores that offer fresh and affordable foods needed to maintain a healthy diet. Instead of such stores, these districts often contain many fast food restaurants and convenience stores.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert)\n\nBasically, if we follow your reasoning, the poor would be penalized for not living in an area that provides enough healthy food. To me, this is not fair and another reason why it should not be considered abuse.\n\n3. Junk food lasts longer. \n\nWhen you are broke, you may not have a car. Even if you do, it is usually unreliable, and even if it is reliable, you can't afford to make lots of trips. Even if you can afford it, you may not have the time due to working long hours/multiple jobs.  If you live in an area where your store is more than a mile or two away, making multiple trips to the store can cost you a lot of money. When I was broke and on foodstamps, my nearest store was almost 20 minutes away. I did not have a car and had to rely on friends to drive me to the store whenever they could. This resulted in me buying 'junk' and frozen foods because I did not know when my next ride would be and I could not afford to buy food that would spoil within 2 weeks. \n\nI did freeze many fruits and vegitables. However, my freezer was not big and there was no way I could fit two weeks worth of fruits and veggies in there.\n\n[An image that may be of interest to you](http://americannutritionassociation.org/sites/default/files/food-deserts.jpg)\n\n4. Over eating is not meant to be abusive.\n\nUnfortunately, you are right that forcing your child to clean their plate is bad. Your child should stop when they feel full. This was something we were taught at when the DHS had mandatory workshops for people on foodstamps. I already knew this, but I was surprised at the people who did not. It was a room full of people and when the teacher told them that making them finish their plate usually leads to obesity, they were so shocked. And they looked so guilty. One woman even sounded close to tears. \n\nI bring this up because even though it is not a good thing, it is not done out of neglect or bad intentions. This tradition comes from what their parents and grand parents taught them. And an important thing to remember is their parents and grandparents came from the depression and WW2 era when food was scarce and you did not know when or if you would get another meal. Nowadays, this is not needed, but referring back to an earlier point, these parents do not know what they are doing is harmful because they were raised that way. \n\nIt is unfair to label these parents abusive when they just do not know any other way to raise and feed their children. \n\n5. Some families do not have power in their homes so that makes storing healthy foods impossible/hard.\n\nEven if food desert is not a problem for the area you live in, you would be surprised how many families do not have power in their homes. This makes eating healthy even harder.\n\n\n6. Some parents simply do not have the time to cook and prepare healthy meals.\n\nI understand this is a statement that makes people angry. I use to be that way too. However, my views changed when I had to work two jobs just to get by. I was completely exhausted. At that point in my life, I would eat just so I would not pass out. I simply saw eating as a means to an end, not a health measure. \"Just let me eat so I can pass out and go back to work\" was my thought. \n\nMy situation was easier than most. Most men and women I worked with or talked with at the DHS worked multiple jobs and had no knowledge on how to eat healthy. It is very easy to judge a person like this, but try to imagine what it must be like to have no idea how to eat healthy (or worse, you believe you are eating healthy due to food companies trickery) and you barely have time to shop, let alone cook. \n\n7. These laws would punish the poor.\n\nMost of the problems with bad eating comes from lack of money and knowledge. The workshops my DHS provided were very helpful and they helped a lot of families. These families need more help and more education to correct their problems, not punishment. They are already suffering enough, having a child abuse label over them would make things so much worse and they would not learn a damn thing.\n\nI hope this has changed your mind a bit. This information comes from me being poor and living on foodstamps for over a year, and working within the DHS along side poor families and becoming friends with many caseworkers who further informed me of my misconceptions of the poor.\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

Says who?  Just because something costs money, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an automatic additional stress for parents.  I would counter that and argue that deciding to have a baby in general will cause you financial stress.  Whether you breastfeed or not.\n\nPrescription only?  How can you even begin to consider making something that is perfectly healthy for you, impossible to over dose on, and non-addictive available only by prescription?  I don\u2019t even need a prescription for alcohol or cigarettes, and those are things have been proven to be bad for you and/or a danger to your health.\n\nCiting WHO?  Of course the WHO recommends breast feeding.  So does every doctor.  So does every parent.  Everyone does, because that is what breasts are for and you can make a real good argument that that is what is best for the baby.\n\nHonestly, I could make a similar argument for why we should force parents to use cloth diapers vs. disposable.  They are reusable, far more affordable then disposable and have a much better impact on the environment.

This causes a lot of problems because this is unfortunately the standard women are judging themselves against and, perhaps more importantly, the standard that men think they should expect in a wife(and vice versa) I see a lot of people so focused on attaining this \"pinnacle of beauty\" that they forget to put focus on more import things, like personality, education, and career goals. On top of this, the media often doesn't portray a healthy body as the go to for beauty, but rather a semi-anorexic 6-ft tall model. This leads to teenage girls starving themselves rather than exercising and eating healthy.

I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I\u2019m not religious, can\u2019t dismiss it due to taste (although I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as \u201cI just don\u2019t drink\u201d, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t want to become like you\u201d after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I\u2019ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don\u2019t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I\u2019ve yet to attend one of these uni events. \n\nNot that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. \u201cOh, you\u2019re drinking *that*?\u201d, \u201cthis wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste\u201d, to which I can only roll my eyes.\n\nI also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.\n\nAt the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers.

Lots to read and think about \u2013 I'll try to reply to as many comments as I can tonight.\n\n**Edit 2** Based on most of the comments I should simply have a couple of drinks before forming a definite opinion on the subject. While that seems quick and easy, the idea of me drinking is almost unimaginable to me. Can't even picture it. I don't know how to deal with this, maybe it'll come with age (or desperation?). All this has really made me think about myself in a different way and that will need some time to process.\n\n**Edit 3** You've C'd my V, at least to some extent. I figure as I'm only a teen for a few more weeks I might as well mark the occasion. Won't pop my alcohol cherry at uni with people I only know very platonically though.

You take pride in not drinking because you believe it takes self discipline, when from my perspective it takes none at all.  \n\nSelf discipline implies that you have the personal strength to avoid a particular temptation.  Someone on a diet choosing to eat a salad (which they hate) over fast food (which they love) is discipline.  A recovering alcoholic choosing to abstain from alcohol even though he really wants it takes discipline.  *You* choosing to abstain from alcohol does not take discipline, it doesn't require strength, because you despise alcohol, there is no temptation for you.  You look down on those who chose to drink any amount of alcohol and feel superior as a result.\n\nDon't get me wrong, choosing not to drink alcohol is not the end of the world.  You can have a very fulfilling life and have a lot of fun without it, but **you *will miss out on a lot of life experiences**, many of which may not even directly involve alcohol.\n\nYou are going to miss out on making a lot of great friends and meeting interesting people simply because they drink alcohol and you do not, just because you judge them for their personal choices and not for who they are.  You are going to miss out on events because your friends will assume you didn't want to go because there would be some drinking involved.  You are going to miss out on meeting tons of great woman who you probably wouldn't be able to start a conversation with outside of social events such as parties or at bars.  You are going to to miss out on many great nights hanging out with your friends because they were drinking and they assume you wouldn't want to come.  \n\nThat last one is a big one to me, some of my favorite memories are simply drinking with a small group of friends and talking.  People are less socially anxious with a few beers in them and you get to have deeper conversations that they normally would never talk about because they are too shy.\n\nMy advice to you is to go to a bar or to a friends house and have a drink or two, see how it feels.  Maybe you will realize that it is not the worst thing in the world and that life will go on after trying it.  Maybe you might actually enjoy the feeling of having a slight buzz.  Maybe you will at least learn to be comfortable around it and can have a drink or two so you wont miss out on many of the opportunities life has to offer.  But you will never know unless you try.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

I\u2019ve been to a few stereotypical high school parties where people have asked me why I don\u2019t drink on several occasions. I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I\u2019m not religious, can\u2019t dismiss it due to taste (although I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as \u201cI just don\u2019t drink\u201d, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t want to become like you\u201d after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I\u2019ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don\u2019t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I\u2019ve yet to attend one of these uni events. \n\nNot that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. \u201cOh, you\u2019re drinking *that*?\u201d, \u201cthis wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste\u201d, to which I can only roll my eyes.\n\nI also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.\n\nAt the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers. I cannot relate to their weekend antics at a fundamental level and I fear that I might miss out on things I\u2019ll never be able to experience later on. I\u2019m torn on the issue \u2013 on the one hand I want to be more *normal*, on the other hand I take pride in having stood up to peer-pressure for so many years and practiced a fair amount of  self-discipline. Please CMV.\n\n**Edit** Wow, thanks for all the responses! Lots to read and think about \u2013 I'll try to reply to as many comments as I can tonight.\n\n**Edit 2** Based on most of the comments I should simply have a couple of drinks before forming a definite opinion on the subject. While that seems quick and easy, the idea of me drinking is almost unimaginable to me. Can't even picture it. I don't know how to deal with this, maybe it'll come with age (or desperation?). All this has really made me think about myself in a different way and that will need some time to process.\n\n**Edit 3** You've C'd my V, at least to some extent. I figure as I'm only a teen for a few more weeks I might as well mark the occasion. Won't pop my alcohol cherry at uni with people I only know very platonically though. Will instead invite very close childhood friends for a night of cooking, board games and drinking (baby steps). You guys have been stressing drinking in moderation, so if anyone would provide more detailed insight into that I'd be grateful (I'm 6\", 135 lbs if that's of any assistance). Also tips on what to drink/mix for a total newbie would be great. Deltas will be awarded in due time, gotta catch some Zs first.  \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Usually these would be resolved in a matter of hours, and we'd be a \"happy family\" again. But earlier this year, probably around February, things got worse.  Rob changed.  He was no longer the nice man my mom went on dates with.  He wasn't the guy my mom fell in love with.  He became angry, and started to lash out at my brother and I. My brother (younger) especially. My mom had to leave her job, so now she's unemployed. This adds some extra stress in her life, as we are trying to sell our old house and she doesn't have a job.\n\nI don't know what the deal with Rob is. He apparently had a rough childhood, and his parents had a terrible marriage. He's been married before, divorced, and lost the ability to see his child. He's also been with untrustworthy partners, from what I gather. He's constantly accusing my mom of things she'd never do. He's become blinded by his past relationships.\n\nMy mom just wants to appease him. She's had some horrid relationships as well. She's been lied to, made to feel like dirt, worthless, and dishonest. Whenever my Rob needs something done, she's always the first one to jump to help. She's also the first to apologize when *anything* goes wrong. She's become paranoid.\n\nLately, the arguments have become really heated. A week ago, I called my mom to help give her directions to a performance of mine. I called her while she was in the car with my brother and Rob. She answered the phone crying. It was her birthday. She sat in the audience with my brother inbetween her and Rob.  Earlier today, I laid down to take a nap.  I woke up to them arguing in the other room. It went on for an hour.  I heard every word.  Rob wanted her to admit to something she didn't feel. Like he wanted her to say something rude to him, just so he could play the pity card and be right.  He always has to be \"right.\" He's never wrong.\n\nHe always talks about wanting to \"keep the family together,\" and how we all need to pull our own weight and not be selfish. It's really hypocritical, considering things that are considered, \"for the good of this family,\" end up being all about him.\n\nFor example, my brother and I sometimes leave empty drinking glasses on the coffee table or nightstands. We just forget, we're teenage boys. We probably shouldn't leave those glasses there, but then again, we're not exactly pulling the family apart. But if you asked Rob, he'd tell you about how we're trying to undermine his authority by intentionally leaving glasses laying out. What started as something to keep our dinnerware in check (\"You need to put those glasses in the dishwasher, so we can have clean glasses and not run out.\"), turned into a personal attack against this family (\"You're not putting the glasses back because you know I want you to, and you're being defiant on purpose.\"). This is one \"offense\" among many, but still.\n\nMy mom is so upset.  She's a nervous wreck all the time, and breaks down sometimes.  I can't blame her, you have to step on eggshells around Rob, because you don't know what will set him off. She told me that probably after my brother graduates, she'll divorce Rob, and that she's never going to get married again. I can't blame her, and I have the same view.\n\nBeing only a high school student, my relationships don't really hold any weight, I know, but I've still met girls that I've had serious feelings for, and I thought they felt the same, but they end up abusing my feelings in the relationship for their own gain. I've been with girls who, as soon as things started getting serious, changed completely into a totally different person, a person that I did not want to be with.  My friends have had these kinds of relationships too, ones that made them miserable all for the sake of \"love.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, I believe love is a real force, and that love can be very powerful; it would be juvenile to deny that.  However, at the same time, there's no guarantee that love will last forever, or that the other person will ever feel as strongly in love as you. And that's where my opposition to serious relationships and marriages comes in:\n\nMost marriages fail. The lucky ones get out with a divorce, while the others are forced to stay committed to someone they can't stand.  I imagine, in this sense, marriage is like locking yourself in a room with another person.  Teamwork might be your first response, but after a while, you will start to hate their guts for the smallest reasons.\n\nThen marriage and serious relationships carry a financial commitment.  This is probably my weakest point, but still one to bring up. Owning a large house, supporting a partner, raising children, and the like can be really stressful on your income. Again, I've seen this with relationships and how sometimes it all just boils down to who has money.  People get married just because the other person is wealthy all the time.  There's no real love there.\n\nIf I didn't have to worry about a serious relationship, kids, or marriage, I could keep all fiscal concerns to myself.  Again, sort of a selfish reason for being opposed to relationships, but one I had to bring up.\n\nI don't want to get emotionally attached to anyone either.  I don't want to go through life and have to worry not only about my feelings but the feelings of my partner. I try to be nice all the time, to everyone I know, but only because it's the right thing to do.  People have complex emotions though, and living with a partner, you're forced to work through their emotional stressors while dealing with my own.  One day, they're happy, the next one they want to rip your head off at the slightest hint of trouble. Why should I subject myself to that?\n\nRelationships can be really distracting too. In school or a workplace, you could easily get caught up with romance, which would lower productivity.  And then you have commitments to your partner.  Instead of going out with friends, you have to take your sweetheart to the theater tonight, or maybe she doesn't want you staying so late at work.  If you work in a high risk career field, like the military or law enforcement, they worry about you.  If you don't have a serious relationship, you're *free.*\n\nThis has probably been a little rambly, and I apologize for the repetition.  It's late and I've been writing this on and off for an hour.\n\n**TL;DR: Relationships suck, marriages ruin lives, I've seen it firsthand with my mom and stepdad.  Most marriages fail, so why bother?  Over time, love fades and becomes one-sided or nonexistent in serious relationships. Financially, not having to support anyone but yourself is liberating.

Being a member of a religious or spiritual group conveys a great many very real benefits Those benefits have a value and that value attracts membership.  So, arguing against her beliefs, when her beliefs are a proxy for that group membership is futile because it simply isn't a material argument. \n\nThe second track is to recognize that not all beliefs and actions serve the same purpose. Things like Hasidic dress, wearing a Hijab and ardently espousing YEC are all examples of costly signaling. Costly signaling is a means of gaining trust in a community by enduring a personal cost to demonstrate trustworthiness. The reason hasidic diamond merchants and jewelers will exchange millions of dollars of merchandise on a handshake is because few people would dress that way if they didn't really want to be part of that community. \n\nLikewise, being a vocal YEC in American today comes at a high social price. Therefore, espousing YEC demonstrates that one is a trustworthy member of their particular religious community. This serves a very real economic function that reduces transaction cost across the community and allows for quick identification of who can and can not be considered trustworthy. \n\nIf you like science, look at her behavior in terms of behavioral economics and you'll realize that it is not that you should or should not argue with her, but rather, you have nothing to argue with her about -- at least with respect to the beliefs she is espousing in any context where you'd have that sort of discussion. That doesn't mean you still might not have to tactfully dodge her questions or accusations or whatever, having a different viewpoint on your part won't change whatever interpersonal dynamic you share with her.

But the idea that everything can be revealed through science is itself unscientific because we are not sure whether we as humans even have the cognitive ability to comprehend the universe and nature as it exists independent of our limited perception. We could be like ants living in an anthill 3 inches off the shoulder of a highway. Those ants will never know what it is that they are living next to because they don't have the cognitive ability to know. We are the ants and reality is the highway.\n\nThe few surviving hunter-gatherer cultures all have one thing in common: They see meaning and purpose in everything around them. And as they are fully incorporated into their respective ecosystems, they are participants in that meaning and purpose. As our ancestors adopted agriculture and civilization, their spiritual leaders took the meaning and purpose out of the natural world and consolidated it into a few human-like Gods who live in some otherworldly realm. As time went on, those few Gods became one God, and now some scientists like Richard Dawkins seek to take that one God who for so many encompasses meaning and purpose and turn it off completely. He wants people instead to create their own purpose and meaning through studying science or music or art. But as you point out, these pursuits are ultimately unfulfilling. We humans evolved under certain conditions. Our notion of meaning, purpose, morality, etc developed under those conditions and make little sense when taken and applied to circumstances that are as distant from those conditions as ours are today. For millions of years humans and the now extinct ancestors from which our species evolved lived in small tribal bands taking what we needed from the natural world. It was in these conditions that we developed our notion of meaning and morality. We are now trying to apply those notions to a world of mass industrial production, a world that depends not in seeing the natural world as having innate meaning and purpose, but seeing the natural world as being nothing but soulless resources for us to exploit for our own selfish ends. This is of course why religion was created to replace primitive animism in the first place. People cannot destroy their own land bases by converting it completely to human use unless they see it as dead lifeless matter that exists only for humans to use.\n\nIts hard for us to see much meaning and purpose in the natural world because we are so far removed from it. We spend so much time on these computers, we are even becoming too far removed from one another. But if you do wish to see purpose and meaning, my advice is to make an effort to find it in the world in which we evolved the notion of purpose and meaning in the first place, and that is the life that makes you possible. Because you can exist without churches, synagogues, and the Hadron Collider. But you cannot exist without abundant clean water, clean air, or your family or friends. \n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

In this context, I think you mean some objective purpose to which we all must strive.

What about in terms of human meaning?  In this sense, our actions are likely to be less permanent.  However, a good sustained for 10 days is as meaningful or otherwise as a good sustained for 10 years.  It is merely that some goods are sustainable and others not.\n\nIt is clearly preferable to have 10 years of quality living than to have 10 years of miserable living, even if death inevitably looms.  It is mistaken to think that because something is only good now, that it isn't good because it is temporary.\n\nThings matter on the basis to which we ascribe them importance.  That is to say, my loved ones matter to *me* because I ascribe them that value.  Further, we can develop systems of ethics that accord entities moral importance based solely on their cognitive features, like utilitarianism, because we recognise the important features of being able to value our own experience (self-awareness, minimal intelligence, consciousness, an ability to experience pain)\n\nIn an atheistic universe, the only people capable of producing meaning are beings that are cognitively sophisticated, like humans.

For example everytime in physics if you make a ball of a certain weight and material and roll it down an angle of a certain degree, it will reach the end at the same time, everytime without fail and from this you can discern the laws of the universe. \n\nThe human brain isn't so simple. The biologically speaking, yeah the brain looks pretty simple but actual human behavior is not so simple. Tons of scientists believe in determalism but they have don't have the faintest idea how people will react and do things. The reasoning is that every human is unique and complex, even down to the babies more so even than animals.  figuring out how and why humans do without a basis or rather the basis is always changing  because of the times, is essentially starting off in quantum physics and guess what? The rules are changing, that basis you 30 years ago is now worthless due to the internet and social paradigms switching. \n\nIn that regards, psychology is a *different* science but with a different set of rules. Why we do and how we do is forever changing and unique  but we still need to learn and keep at the cutting edge of such things or we will be maladies to our own mental faults and loops. Like if psychology didn't exist you probably would get addicted very easily and then would have no idea how to break out of that addiction. PTSD would be treated like people are pussies, and we would still be treating the mentally ill and autistic people like animals rather than humans. I mean I can keep going on, but even small stuff like dealing with social anxiety is in the realm of psychology.\n\nThe thing about science though is that the fields cross over. Where do you think the AI research is being done? Certainly in robotics and programming but also a big part is psychology. Trying to understand the human brain so we can mimic it in creation. It requires a basis to move foward and progress.  \n\n&gt;So personality is unique to every individual, it's shaped by their choices and experiences.

Some disorders are celebrated but certainly hurt humans on a personal level and in interpersonal relationships.  \n\nEvery person might have a unique set of disorders but generally if you can find a trend you can study it or share notes with similar traits of other disorders. You complain about there being no foundation of fact but they are trying to establish fact in this case. You can't complain about the lack of foundation when what they do is trying to make one. \n\n&gt;I think a priest or a hooker can offer the same services as a psychologist, so why specialize in it?\n\nPriests and Hookers can't give out killer drugs.

Going out to bars, drinking at parties, on holidays, with meals, these are all common and socially accepted behaviors. While cannabis enjoys growing support in the US, it is still seen as taboo by many. I can call up pretty much anyone I know and say \"want to grab a drink?\" But I can only call a handful of people and say \"want to smoke?\"\n\nI would also challenge the idea that using alcohol is somehow less dangerous than using cannabis.\n\nFirstly, in 2010 the rate of alcohol induced deaths, *excluding* homicide and accidents, was [25,692](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm). The number of deaths attributed to marijuana overdose is [zero](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Causes_of_Death#sthash.eFOl670x.dpbs) every year.\n\nThis is because alcohol becomes toxic if you ingest about six-times the intoxicating dose. Marijuana, on the other hand, has the toxic dose estimated at about 10,000 times the intoxicating dose. (*Illegal Drugs*, Paul Gahlinger).\n\nSo from a practical social standpoint, cannabis does less harm than alcohol. But what about it's addictiveness?\n\nIn fact, while there is evidence that cannabis can cause a psychological dependence, ~~it does not cause a physical one. This is because the [nucleus accumbens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens#Addiction_and_drug_use), the brain's \"reward center,\" does not have THC receptors, so using cannabis does not create the same physical dependence behavior as the use of [cocaine, heroine, nicotine, and alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens#Addiction_and_drug_use), all of which excite the reward center.~~ [1]\n\nWhat about when it's time to kick the habit?\n\nLet's look at the physical effects of detoxing from alcohol dependence. I'm just going to bullet point this one from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism#Alcohol_withdrawal):\n\n* As with barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal can be fatal if it is not properly managed. \n\n* Increased stimulation of the GABAA receptor results in tolerance and physical dependence. \n\n* When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure.\n\nHere are the worst withdrawl symptoms I could find for [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_dependence#Diagnostic_criteria):\n\n\"insomnia, cravings, restlessness, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, sweating, mood swings, raise in temperature, depression, irritability, and anger.\"\n\nNow, while those are definitely negative, they are no where near the drawbacks to kicking alcohol. The bottom line is that, on every front, alcohol addiction is more dangerous and more damaging in the long term.\n\nEdit[1] thanks to /u/Hatious for point out that there [**are** THC receptors in the nucleus accumbens](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/teaching-packets/brain-actions-cocaine-opiates-marijuana/section-iii-introduction-to-drugs-abuse-cocaine-opia-11).\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

When alcohol was legalized, did everyone drink alcohol everyday and think that alcohol was completely safe? No. The same will happen for cannabis in fact more information will be available about the drug, because it will be easier to gain permits to use in studies.\n\nAnother thing you need to understand to have your view changed, is addiction. There is mental addiction as well as physical addiction. The rate at which cannabis users get addicted to cannabis physically, is around 10 percent. For alcohol, it's around 15 percent. That means that you know 5% more alcohol addicts than you do weed addicts. Chances are you know possibly a few alcoholics, and the people litterally addicted to weed are much less than even that number.\n\nAlso ask yourself, is there anything wrong with using a drug everyday? Why? If you answer, because its bad, how do you know? Multiple studies have shown that marijuana is actually a Neuro-protectant and may possibly help with Neuron growth. Multiple people use SSRI's perscribed by doctors every day, which can cause tonnes of harm to the brain.\n\nLife is about enjoyment, fun, happiness. We only have a certain amount  of time on this planet, is if fair that we have to work? Why do we have to work? to pay off debt that the government makes in a way. (this is a whole other topic) But basically, if they are happy and enjoying life, who cares?\n\nAnother thing to consider is the harm that alcohol does to others.

Does the average conservative support easy access to birth control?  Both of these things reduce the number of abortions.

I believe most pro-life people tell themselves it's about concern for the fetus.

(This is sort of more like a minor point.)\n\nIt doesn't actually hurt that much, depending on where on your body you get it. Fleshy part of your calf barely hurts at all. Right on your spine hurts significantly more. But it's a bearable pain. And as has already been stated, some people enjoy pain. \n\n&gt;I can't quite grasp the notion of putting ink under your skin to look differently. That's how tattoos work right? (sort of?)\n\nWell, no. Every person \"looks different\" anyways because of genetics, and their own personal style. Be it how they dress, how they do their hair, make up etc. Lots of people have lots of reasons for getting a tattoo. Maybe you experienced a life changing event that you always want to remember. Maybe a piece of literature changed your view of the world completely. Maybe you met someone who had a huge impact on your life and lost them. I have several tattoos. My first one is a Scottish thistle drawing that my grandmother did. I got it tattooed on my leg after she passed away so that I would always remember her. I have a [Picasso's sketch of Don Quixote](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Donquixote.JPG) on my other leg. Because I love Picasso, and Don Quixote is my favorite book of all time (I'm a huuuuge book person). \n\nYou seem to think most tattoo's are people just going into the shop and picking a rose and crossbones from the wall and pointing to a body part. That's not what *most* tattoos are about. However it does happen. Friend of mine got a gargoyle that he just picked off a wall. Now 10 years later it looks like shit, but my Don Quixote still looks as bad ass as it did the day I got it. The gargoyle doesn't *mean*anything to him. Mine means something to me. \n\n&gt;Aren't most tattoos stuff you'd regret later? At least when your 80 or something, when your wrinkled skin completely fucks up the tattoo.\n\nIt happens, but it is no where near \"most\". Like I pointed out above. If you get something stupid and cheap, then ya, you will probably regret it. But if you get something that means something to you, like my grandmothers thistle sketch, I will never ever regret that. \n\nWhen I'm 80 I will be more worried about not shitting myself than how my tattoos look. I won't give a damn how they look when I'm 80 because I'm old and senile and it won't matter. But again, *the tattoo means something to me*. So its not about how it looks, its about what it means. \n\n&gt;Wouldn't it be really awkward to encounter someone with the same or a similar tattoo? It is kind of awkward with just clothing, is it like that with tattoos?\n\nThat is why it is stupid to just go pick something off the parlor wall or to get cliched common ones like nautical stars or tribal bands. Those ones don't hold any meaning for the person. If you actually take the time to think about it, make your design yourself or with the help of the artist, most meaningful tattoo's will be unique. For example a different friend of mine has a coat of arms from a fictional book that she loves. There were no previous *images* of this coat of arms, just a description from the books, and so she designed it herself. \n\nTattoos can be stupid. I'm sure there are lots of stupid tattoos out there. There was a thread just the other day on askreddit asking artists what the worst tattoo they had to do was. But if your smart about it, and choose something that has meaning to you, then it can be an incredible experience and something that you will treasure for the rest of your life. \n\nAlso: Your body is your temple.

It is a perfectly valid view. However, I think you need to understand *why* people enjoy tattoos. I'm pretty bad at formatting, but I'll try to format it so that each point is addressed.\n\n1) A lot of things hurt. This doesn't make them bad. Getting dental work done hurts. So what? It is fixing a problem that you had for the better. In high school I performed in the marching bad and was also active in DCI. We had to be at practice at 5:30 in the morning in the cold of winter to practice, and *a lot* of physical work went into this. It hurt. It sucked. We complained. But we came out with something incredible. Sometimes pain is the pathway to something great and beautiful. Now, tattoos hurt for some people, but not all. Also, it is pretty dependent on where your body you get the tattoo, so pain may not even be a factor *at all*. Secondly, as my previous examples showed, pain can lead to good things. In the case of tattoos, it is using their body the way *they* want to promote something that *they* probably really care about.\n\n2) Yes this is how tattoos work. I am not sure how to answer this question for you. You may not want ink under your skin, but others will for various reasons that you may never understand. Doesn't make it stupid. Just something that you, yourself, are not interested in.\n\n3) No. Plain and simple, no. Maybe sometimes, sure, but most people willing to spend that much money on something permanent on their body is going to consider this, so they will put the tattoo in a reasonable location. Not all skin ends up flabby and gross, especially if you take care of yourself. \n\n4) There are 7 billion people in the world. That is a fuck ton of people. No matter what you do, you will inevitably end up similar to many people in some ways. Why should this be a bad thing? It just means that you have something in common.\n\nYour issue seems that you just don't get why people don't want a tattoo. Which is OK. You don't have to think it is ok. What I do want you to understand is why many people *do* in fact enjoy tattoos, and your four questions don't at all get into that.\n\nDo some people make really awful decisions with tattoos? Yes, But that is true of most things. The fact of the matter is that most people understand the money and commitment this entails and get a tattoo that represents something to *them*. Not to you. Maybe you see it as dumb, but it really isn't. These people are using their self-owned bodies in the way they damn please for something that means a lot to them. \n\nSome people get tattoos for fashion reasons. Sometimes they suck, sometimes they don't.\n\nSometimes people get tattoos to represent something they really care about. Sometimes they suck, sometimes they don't.\n\nThe point is that your four bullet points don't mean much here. Yes, they hurt. Yes, ink goes under your skin. Yes, some people may regret it, but *many*, probably most, don't. Yes, it may be awkward to encounter someone similar to you in some way if you're convinced that you are some ultra special snowflake (which you really aren't). \n\nThe point is that these people are using their own bodies, which they inherently own, in ways that they find ultimately meaningful. The fact that some people may fuck this up does not mean that tattoos as a whole become \"stupid,\" it just means that stupid people will do stupid things.

If I am aware of the risks, probably more so than some government lawmakers, most of whom have never used a laser pointer in their life, should I not be allowed to own them and use them in the privacy of my own home?\n\nAll this despite most people from developed countries viewing freedom as something super important and something to be proud of having. I don't think any country in the world is truly free, since laws like this exist everywhere.\n\nPlease explain this to me, and change my view if it should be changed.\n\n**EDIT**: I have been reading all the responses, sorry if I don't respond to all, this blew up a little bit\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Depending on the drugs, they might affect a lot more than just you. I don't have much of a problem with drugs like marijuana. It seems like plenty of people can function just fine and suffer relatively few side effects. They can still be functioning members of society.\n\nHowever, once we get to heavier drugs, society has an interest in their regulation. Drug abuse can be a [huge cost to society](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/addiction-science-molecules-to-managed-care/introduction/drug-abuse-costs-united-states-economy-hundreds-billions-dollars-in-increased-health) as a whole. Drug addicts are less productive, more likely to miss work, and have more health problems. Our current drug laws also cause drug users to commit more crime and waste law enforcement resources.\n\nObviously, we need to change our drug laws. The question is, to what extent?\n\n2.) At the very least, we need to teach people about the negative effects of drug abuse without demonizing drug use or drug abusers. If we legalize harder drugs, we have to tax them heavily to make up for the cost to society. That is part of the reason I am ok with taxing cigarettes pretty heavily. The people who smoke should have to carry a lot of the cost for the loss of productivity and the health care costs. Similarly, if you want to use meth, cocaine, or heroine, you should have to pay a tax for all the negative side effects your actions have on society as a whole. \n\n\nPersonally, I don't care what people do with their own lives. If someone wants to screw up their life with drug abuse, that is on them.\n\nBut I also feel a certain responsibility to educate people on why drug abuse is a concern and how it can ruin lives. This isn't just about illicit drugs, though. I'm pretty sure that prescription drug abuse is a lot more rampant. People need to know that abusing oxycodone or hydrocodone can kill you, especially if alcohol is involved.\n\n\n**TLDR**: The government has a vested interest in making sure individuals aren't a drain on the economy. Drug laws have to somehow balance personal freedom with societal ramifications.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

Do they actually have scientific studies to back their claims up?\n\n[All of this is answered on this site.](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm)  To summerize, the rate of effectiveness is determined using a double blind test (the standard for medical science).  The percentage given is the reduction in the likelihood of a person getting the flu with the vaccine as compared to without.  So if they say it is 40% to 60% effective, that means if you get the vaccine you are about half as likely to get the flu as if you didn't.  As for vaccines making you less likely to get the desies dispite exposing you to it, [this principle has been known since the 1700's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#History) and is kind of old news in the realm of science.\n\n&gt;Not only that but the vaccines have mercury in them with is a known poison that doesn't leave your system easily (if at all).\n\nThe mercury in vaccines is contained in a compound known as thimerosal.  [Thimerosal has an LD50 of 75 mg/kg,](http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9925236) meaning that a 150 pound person will need about 5103 mg for a 50% chance of a lethal dose.  The amount of thimerosal in the vaccines that have it (not all do and you can easily request one that does not have it) have only a trace amount [(0.01%)](http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228), so you will need to get a massive volume of the vaccine in your system for it to even have an affect on you, let alone be dangerous.\n\n&gt;People say \"herd immunity\" which makes sense for things like malaria and polio, but the flu evolves every year and they're just guessing on the variety they put in the flu shot. Most importantly the side effects are severe and fairly common including some side effects that are far worse than almost any that you can get from the actual flu.\n\nThe method to determine exactly what strain to create a vaccine for has some pretty complicated math invovled (which I admit I don't fully understand), [but the criteria they look at is explained here.](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/virusqa.htm#virus-selection)  \n\nBecause you acknowledge the advantage of herd immunity for malaria and polio, I am going to assume you know how it works.  Let me know if you want me to explain it.\n\n&gt;By far the most common consequence of not getting the flu shot ranges from nothing at all to getting the flu which is miserable, but better than the side effects.\n\nI'm not sure what side effects you are talking about here.  To my knowledge, the most severe side effects ever associated with the flu vaccine is getting the flu (which is extremely rare), and most side effects are something along the lines of a headache or a mild fever.  Even then, side effects are pretty rare and the vast majority of people report none at all.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

There is a well established division within the 'scientific' community between hypothesis driven and exploratory research, as a matter of fact. Apparently the latter half is just 'support', or something?\n\nIt seems like - on your definition - entire fields constituted of people who call themselves scientists, are not really science.\n\nLet's suppose I spend 2 years working hard in the lab on a new project to characterise important factors for the motility of a parasite, in order to generate possible targets for drug discovery. I'll describe the kind of thing that might involve. \n\nSo suppose I knocked out a panel of genes in my parasite and saw that one of the gene-knockout strains had abnormal/ablated motility when looked at in the microscope. Then I break open some normal parasite cells and isolate the protein, after which I check to see if anything else comes out along with it (any other proteins binding to it, for instance). I see from this that it does interact with some other proteins, so I find out the amino acid sequence of each one. \n\nUsing the amino acid sequences, I search a database of the parasite's genome to see where the corresponding genes are - I find them there, and I use that knowledge to isolate the DNA of each gene from the parasite. Several of these genes were previously unknown. Not only that, but let's imagine I realise one of the genes is a well studied protein already known to have important roles in parasite motility - as a 'scientist', my pulse would be racing at this point. \n\nSo anyway, I put each gene (including the original gene I knocked out) inside a strain of *E.coli* so that I can make large amounts of protein for each on demand. I do that, then purify the proteins again in large quantities and I determine their crystal structures of each protein in a big interacting complex, from which I learn - just by looking - that **my** gene that I knocked out seems to play an important role in maintaining the structure of the already 'famous' protein. \n\nElated, I submit my work to the journal *Science* and my groundbreaking investigation is lauded as one of the most important within the field for years. But you know what? I discovered several new genes, one of which is important to the parasite's motility (and therefore infectivity), and discovered a key missing link in understanding the function of an already very well studied protein... didn't do any science though, according to you.\n\nNeither did Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Francis Crick do any science when they got the structure of DNA. Nor did the Human Genome Project when they found out so much about our own genetic make up. And actually, the whole disciplines of genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics? Not really science. Oh yeah - theoretical physics? Not science.\n\nI would put it that any definition of science as exclusive as yours doesn't really capture what people mean by 'science', and for that reason should not be entertained.\n\nEDIT: DAMN, I just wrote all that and then realised you already had your mind changed.

My view is probably more a matter of preserving my romantic notion of the pursuit of truth rather than the reality of having to learn from existing natural experiments either to generate more meaningful hypotheses or to have the rigorously gathered data needed to perform retrospective studies.\n\nMy friend and I had an argument about what is science. My initial position was that until you begin to formulate and test hypotheses what you are doing isn't science. For instance, coming up with ideas, being rigorous, and being an expert does not make you a scientist. \n\nThis is not to say that ideation, rigor, and expertise are not neccessary, just that you do not have science with without something to test and the means to test it.\n\nAs an aside, another concern I had was that we give credence to the creation of ideas without the process then you are labeling a process \"science,\" with its associated authority, when it should not have that authority.

As a communist, I rationalise the stability of a future stateless society using historical materialism. Here's my take.\n\nHistorical materialism posits that society (including ideas of state, religion, and culture) are merely outgrowths from peoples' relationship with the means of production- referred to as the mode of production. The mode of production is influenced by what exactly the tools of economic production are. Therefore, a society whose fields are tilled by oxen will have different productive relations(mode of production) than one whose fields are tilled by machines or one that has foregone fields altogether and goes for some futuristic hydroponics scheme.\n\nKarl Marx, the most noted historical materialist (he coined the phrase), noted the trend of the industrialisation of menial labour. Where in the medieval age, vehicle construction was an artisan's task, industrial capitalism introduced interchangeable parts, division of labour, and after Marx' time, the assembly line. This had the effect of changing how people organised production. Feudal lords lost their influence as urban businessmen became prosperous from their new factories and the state was realigned to facilitate the new state of affairs, with representative democracy and modern notions of property ownership.\n\nMarxists say a stateless society will be possible when the social conditions that necessitate a state's existence have been removed by technological advancement. Take for example a ridiculous hypothetical situation where infinite cars of any variety are available at any time to anyone. In this situation, society will be vastly different than our own, as the social constructions around cars that we currently entertain will be invalid (theft, loss, insurance, and ownership will be fundamentally changed). Now, that infinite car situation may (I'd say definitely) never come to pass, but it is conceivable that an approximation can be arrived at, abstracting into resources in general from the specific case of cars (Maybe we'll have some replicator system a la Star Trek or even just really fast automated factories and a big supply of raw materials- I don't know the future). The point of the exercise was to show how the mechanics around material abundance influence what we see to be the realm of the political- in time, politics will change owing to increased industrial capacity.\n\nTherefore, unlike anarcho-capitalists, we say that a stateless society takes time to build up (see works on \"socialist construction\") and may still involve a social contract, just not one of the Hobbesian kind. That is to say, people won't owe their allegiance to a singular state abstraction, but to the society in general that provides them with their high quality of life.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

I became an anarcho-capitalist when I found that, because price mechanisms makes economic calculation possible, thereby enabling the production and distribution of scarce goods and services to be optimized ad hoc to maximizing value, and public sector goods and services are not priced according to voluntary negotiations as is done in a free market, then all goods and services that are produced and distributed in the public sector can be better done by the private sector. Furthermore, all goods and services that are currently dominated by the public sector has been implemented in the private sector in the past; roads were constructed by traders and private interests before the government decided to control the production of roads. Therefore, all public sector goods and services can be produced and distributed with higher quality and lower cost if they were privatized.\n\nAnarcho-Capitalism is essentially a consistent application of libertarianism on all aspects of politics and economics, and the privatization of everything, which would make the government irrelevant.\n\nOne thing to consider is how the public sector approaches the economic calculation problem with the production of public infrastructure. How does the government know where to build roads, and how much road to build, so as to maximize the value that all other people get from roads in relation to the costs of the roads that comes from taxation. Unless the production and distribution of goods and services are regulated by individual choices in a free society, economic calculation becomes very much impossible, and inefficiency and waste would be the result. The massive interstate highway system has not been proven to have been a good economic choice because no one has a choice of whether or not they want to pay for the government-funded road system. Private roads, on the other hand, are paid for according to use, so it would only be profitable and financially stable in the long run if other people value the road's location and quality relative to the price of the road.

You can enjoy food in a whole different way when you open up your palate.\n\n* Alcohol helps you relax. Even just a first sip of a beer is psychologically relaxing. (Part of the medical benefit is from relaxation, iirc)\n\n* Alcohol is a social drug and it sucks to be the sober guy around drinking people. It also sucks to be the drunk guy around sober people, or the very drunk guy around buzzed people.\n\n* The negative effects of alcohol are relatively easy to avoid (unless, perhaps, you have a family history of alcoholism or a tendency toward substance abuse)\n\nYou do not need to drink, and if you do you do not need to get drunk, and if you do, you certainly do not need to drink to the point of blacking out. If you are in your late 20s, that type of behaviour is probably already looked down upon (depending on your crowd).\n\nAll I can say is that I was against drinking because my father was an alcoholic. I think I first tried it around 21 and realized how harshly I had pre-judged it. Alcohol is not bad, it is a tool, a drug like all the rest. If the user uses the tool badly we should not blame the tool. Over time I became a more sophisticated drinker and now I prefer the right beer or wine with certain meals. What are your other options?

But I am certainly open to non-American examples as well.\n\nThe threat of prosecution undermines peaceful transition of power.  Peaceful transition of power between political adversaries is the defining feature of a democracy governed by the rule of law.  If you do not peacefully transition power, you're not a democracy.  The threat of prosecution is deeply corrosive to the willingness of leaders to give up power.  If the opposition makes clear they intend to imprison you upon their victory, you are not likely to hand over the reins of power to them.\n\nEven for a leader engaged in open criminality like Nixon, we should be willing to offer a plea of no prosecution in exchange for surrendering the power of office.  It is more important that the office transfer peacefully and within the confines of the law than it is that a particular person be put in prison.\n\nEgypt's recent history is indicative of this to me.  The prosecutions of Mubarak, then Morsi, then undoing Mubarak have made it wildly implausible that any leader who takes power in Egypt again would hand over office willingly, since your opposition will drag you off to prison for some charge, legitimate or no.\n\n**TL;DR: Peaceful transition of power is more important than achieving retribution for crimes.**\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Stephen Hawking has even made this point.\n\nI agree with the line of reasoning that all these can only serve to push up the probability of life out there, but I don't think that they  necessarily guarantee it or even make it likely. The main problem I have is that we don't know (or at least I don't think we know) the probability any given planet can and **will** have life. Since we live on the only known example of a planet that supports life we might be over estimating this probability. What if the chances that any given planet, even an Earth-like one, were to have life on it is 1 in a trillion? We would see that there are 500 billion planets and think that it virtually guarantees extraterrestrial life but it would actually only be a 50/50 proposition.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Ergo the vastness of the universe has no inherent implication for the likelihood of life on other planets'\n\nIf I have that more or less right, then I agree with you. But we also have a very low data set of whether earth-like planets do or do not have life. No data set, actually. So the odds could be 1 in 100 Trillion, or they could be 4 in 5. So I ask: Given the possibility of virtually any odds, what are the odds that those odds are so astronomically low as to never occur twice in  1,000,000,000,000,000,000 instances (thats 1 billion billion, the number of estimated earth-like planets according to a study by [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19273.abstract))?\n\nIt's possible.

Some black people could take offense at being called black, similarly to how an Asian may take offense to being called yellow. \"African American\", however, is universally accepted as being the politically correct way to refer to someone of that race (as well as Asian American).\n\n\nAnother thing is that your idea of equality appears to involve ignoring the existence of any race at all. This may seem logical, but it isn't right. Many people attribute their cultures, beliefs, morals, etc directly to their races. Ignoring the fact that there are different races is like ignoring the cultures of those people. \n\n\nI'm a Hispanic American. Although technically I am Caucasian, on legal documents I always put down that I am Hispanic given the option. Not because I don't think I'm Caucasian, but because I *identify* with being Hispanic, and I want my government to acknowledge that.\n\n\nIt isn't about skin color or race, it is about identity. We are all proud to be Americans, but we also haven't forgotten about out roots, be them Africa, Cuba, or anywhere else in the world.\n\n\nJust because we want to be treated the same, doesn't mean we want to all be the same. \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind"}]}

A subset of those principles forms the basis of non-discrimination laws. It is clear that you are talking about the private sector, not government entities. I imagine that you agree that government entities should adhere to non-discrimination laws.\n\nOwning and operating a for profit business is a privilege, not an fundamental right. This privilege has terms and conditions set forth by the local, state, and federal levels of government. You, as an American citizen, have the right to bear arms, right to free speech, etc. You do not have an inalienable right to form a for profit business under any terms you want.\n\nThere are terms dictating what you can and can't sell. Most states extend that to prohibit prostitution. Certain counties in Nevada do not.\n\nSome states dictate what intoxicating plants you can legally sell. Other do not.\n\nEvery district in this country has a different combination of terms and conditions that you have to abide by in order to do business.\nOne of the biggest fundamental terms that you must abide by is the set of anti-discrimination laws. They are infringing on your \"right to discriminate\" in the same way they are infringing on your \"right to sell bazookas and crystal meth.\"\n\nThese rules are part of the game. If you don't like these rules, do business elsewhere.\n\nThe purpose of these laws is to dissuade subtle, low scale racism and discrimination.\n\nIt's for the small business owner who conspicuously has a staff made entirely of X, many of whom are incompetent, when there are more than enough qualified candidates of Y applying.\n\nAn example put forth on a similar thread was about the subtle, slight systemic racism by Denny's. There was a class action lawsuit that demonstrated that black customers received poorer service, longer wait times, etc etc in a statistically significant amount.\n\nThe laws are in place to discourage behavior, not to find internal corporate documents laying out how to apply systemic discrimination.\n\nThey are also more applicable in smaller economic environments. What happens when you are the only gay person in a small community of 300? If they are legally allowed to discriminate against you, you could be potentially barred not just from jobs, but from essential services. Anything from your groceries, to the gas station, to your electricity could be denied to you.\n\nHow in the world does this kind of society sound justifiable? I understand the exhaustion that can come from perpetual political correctness, but you have to clearly see the greater good here.\n\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

[Spain's fascist and Nazi regime in WW2 has a policy of removing children from \"unfit parents\".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_children_of_Francoism)  \n\n&gt;The military regime led by Francisco Franco had an ideology with racist components.[5] The soldiers who took part in the coup considered themselves to be of a superior race: They believed that their superiority granted them the right of conquest over other \"inferior races\", which included the Republicans and all others who opposed the military coup.\n\n&gt;His interpretation of race, however, had more political, cultural, and psychological components than ethnic ones  ...  It was believed that racial inferiority could be corrected at an early age. As such, infants were taken from their \"red\" mothers to avoid \"their contamination and degeneration\". The Falange and the Spanish church played an important role in this attempt at racial purification.[5] Much of the time, these kidnappings were done to benefit couples who had adopted the Francoist regime and wished to have children.[5]\n\n&gt;The kidnapping of children eventually became a state policy. The Ministry of Justice adopted the responsibility of \"collecting\" the children whose parents who had been assassinated, jailed, or had disappeared, with the goal of indoctrinating them with the new state model.\n\n&gt;The number of abducted children is estimated to be up to 300,000.\n\nI would urge you to watch [this documentary](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-30000-lost-children-of-the-franco-years-are-set-to-be-saved-from-oblivion-2173996.html) for more insight into the specifics.  It wasn't limited to political dissidents, often unwed mothers or those in relative poverty were targeted as \"unfit\".  The specifics of it are pretty harrowing.  \n\nChildren are meant to be raised by their parents.  Bonding and socialization happens at both a chemical and psychological level and is *powerful* for both parent and child.  The idea of carrying a deeply loved baby through a pregnancy only to have it ripped from your arms is horrifying.  Not to mention the psychological implications of taking a very young child from its parents.  There is a reason why we react so viscerally to the suggestion and why adoption is the exception, not the norm.\n\nFinally, were this policy to be adopted officially and publicly (under Francoism it was secret) I would expect some pretty intense civil unrest.  There are not a lot of things I think might cause violent revolt, but putting parents nationwide in fear of losing their children...

Someone who is healthy, to me, has a reduced risk of both acute and chronic disease, illness or other conditions.  Additionally, their lifestyle promotes an overall wellbeing, both measurable (physical) and unmeasurable (mental).  With that in mind, let's think about what you're advocating for.\n\nFirst, you're creating a false dichotomy: eating nutritious foods (that is, foods with high nutrient density) and working out are not mutually exclusive.  Optimally, people would be working out *and* eating foods which met their daily caloric and nutrient needs.  Most people aren't elite-raw powerlifters.  They don't have hours a day to devote to physical fitness.  For them, choosing to eat more nutrient-rich foods and exercise when possible is a much more practical way to achieve wellbeing.\n\nIn fact, part of why \"eating healthy\" has become such a phenomenon is that it's very easy relative to working out for hours a day.  You do pretty much everything you would normally do anyway: grocery shop, prepare meals, eat food.  Except instead of so-called \"junk food\", you instead are eating nutrient dense foods.  You change very little about your day-to-day life, while dramatically improving your wellbeing.\n\nAsk Jonnie Candito or any serious lifter: why is squatting such a great lift?  It engages every major muscle group in your body, strengthens bones and connective tissue, all in a single exercise!  Imagine if someone instead did six other isolation lifts which hit quads, hamstrings, ankle/stabilizers, core, shoulders, and gluts/hip flexors.  Nutrient dense foods are like squatting for food: they provide the body with many essential things at the same time.  Is it possible to replicate some of the effects of squats with other lifts?  Sure, but squats are a one-stop shop!\n\nJonnie Candito eating McDonalds or any other IIFYM diet is doing to food what other people are doing for their overall health: making it simpler so you don't have to think about every facet.  It's hard to measure or tally every calorie and vitamin and mineral which enters your body, and it's hard to work out 3 hours a day.

The only things that keep the situation now from resembling what you describe (though I think we're as close a practically possible to what you describe with the current system) are the upswing of federal power, the general incompetence of present state governments and heavy gerrymandering of electoral districts.\n\nSplitting up into separate countries wouldn't solve the problem because contrary to the \"Red State-Blue State\" narrative, America isn't really divided by geographical lines.  If we actually broke the blue and red down to individual towns and cities, you wouldn't have to back up too far before it started looking purple.  So breaking up into separate countries really won't resolve that many ideological conflicts, and it *will* introduce inevitable regional conflicts between Balkanized countries.  How long before the Country of Michigan decides that it's economic problems can best be solved by raiding New York?  How long before two countries in the west start wars over water or grazing rights?  What happens when bread basket countries extort richer ones by withholding food?  History suggest that those conflicts are inevitable.\n\nThat highlights a disunity that, even if it never actually turned into open conflict) would absolutely hamstring American economic and diplomatic power.  From an economic perspective, we lose the ability to bargain and act as one powerful unit, which means that each country is vulnerable to exploitation by 'foreign' powers.  All in all, it wouldn't just hurt the US; the fracturing of arguably the most stable and lucrative economy on the planet would be a loss for the whole world.  A US housing crisis caused a worldwide recession, imagine what a tectonic fracture of that economy would do.\n\nDiplomatically, you need to be realistic.

We are born, raised, and die.  Just like all the animals and trees, even as far as planets and stars.  Everything that *is*, will become *was*.\n\nYou nor I, nor every other living thing did not decide to want to be born and given life and make something of it.  It wasn't a phase that we wanted to do, like selecting your major in college or choosing to move to a new city.  Life sort of....just happened.\n\nI too have thought about this same question / statement as you have and I would totally agree with you, except on one point.  There is actually a reason for us being alive, the same reason as to why everything else is alive...and that is to breed, carry and pass on its species, whether it be a human or an apple tree.  \n\nEvery living thing is designed to be able to evolve, survive, and multiply.  Think of how every plant and every insect is designed biologically...its sole purpose is to survive and multiply.\n\nBut anyone can argue that we are over-populated, we may have the upper hand now against all predators, but we still haven't gotten the upper hand against time itself.\n\nIn case you were wondering and haven't figured out why I mentioned in my first sentence, \"If you think about it in the *stage of your life right now*\", it is me guessing that you do not have kids at the moment.  (I don't have any kids either btw), but I'm guessing when you have a kid, most people's goals shift from their own personal goals to that of their children.  They will do anything and spend all their time and energy to make sure their kids do well.  Now this is the case for MOST people I assume, and not everybody, hence the neglectful parents out there.\n\nIn my case, I don't plan or want to have children at all (I'm 29 right now), but because I don't plan on multiplying, that doesn't make life pointless.  It CAN be pointless if you want it to.  You could also make it the most important life in history if you also wanted to.  But there is no rule or law stating that you MUST have a good reason for living.\n\nYou are here now.  You are where you are in life right now, and it's all up to you on how you want to experience it.  There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to do it.  You can live it out by experiencing everything you've wanted to experience, you can live it out by traveling all the world, you can live it out being the parent of your child, you can live it out being someone's role model, you can live it out by living in a cave isolated.  It's all up to you.\n\nFor me, as selfish as it is, I want to experience all that I can before it's my time.  When else can you do it?  Yes, it'll all be erased from my mind after I cease to exist, but so what, I exist now and it brings joy to me.\n\nI kind of see life as a canvas, but not a blank one as another poster mentioned, but more of a canvas that comes with slow-drying paint splashed with different colors and patterns.  Those colors and patterns would be similar, but not the same, as to someone else born in similar surroundings as you (same town, school, city, country).  Given our assortment of paints and patterns, we can make whatever we want with what we have, even maybe borrowing from someone else's canvas or giving them something.\n\nSome people choose to make their canvas the most visually appealing as possible, where people will remember for forever what their canvas looked like.  Some people choose to make their canvas the most useful for other people's canvasses.  These are the ones that spend their time helping other people with their canvasses.  There are also people who choose to just have fun with their canvas without caring about how it looks like or functions in the end.  Some people set a certain structure of how to paint their canvas to their children, while some people aren't satisfied with their canvas, so they tell others not to follow the same pattern.  And sadly, some people choose to even destroy other people's canvasses.\n\nWhen we pass, our canvasses will be washed away.  But while we were making our canvas, we also have been intentionally or unintentionally painting on other people's canvasses.  It can a small dot, or even 80% of someone's canvas.  During the painting of your own canvas, someone else in your life has seen your canvas at the time, and it could have changed the way they were painting their canvas.\n\nIt's not the destination, it's the journey.

In the end I wouldn't move to the USA unless I had a good job lined up with decent security.\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does the following counterargument change your mind?: \"I am from the US, my wife is from the UK.  We've lived in both, plus a couple other countries in mainland Europe.  To compare apples to apples, I'm going to assume you're choosing between the same job in both countries (e.g. near-equivalent standard of living).  Also, it's hard to generalize.  There are states in the US I wouldn't live in, and parts of the UK I wouldn't live in.  Mississippi and Middlesbrough come to mind.\n\nGood things about the US compared to UK/Europe:\n\n1.  Customer service.  Really, the Americans are great at this.  There's a culture of friendliness in most shops, etc. that is really a genuine \"we're here to help you, have a nice day\" that you just don't find in the UK as much.  So much more \"oh, I dunno if I can do that\" attitude in the UK.  It's a palpable relief to walk into a US shop after a while in Europe.\n\n2.  Multiculturalism.  I think Europe has a much more insular \"us vs them\" attitude about immigration in general.  Everywhere has its problems, but in the US the \"culture of immigrants\" is much stronger and it's easier to \"just blend\".\n\n3.  Mobility.  You've got Oxbridge, we've got Harvard, but that attitude is much less in the US. \n\n4.  Sexism.  This one cuts both ways.  On one hand, the Brits are less PC, and you can make jokes in the workplace you just can't make in the US.  But as a whole, the US is more even and less traditional here.  This is really noticed if you have kids.  In the UK, it still feels like 20 years ago, everyone expects the \"mums\" to be home with the kids.  US doesn't have that attitude.  Building on that last point, just the overall sense of diversity in terms of class attitudes is better in the US.  It's just relaxing to feel less judged by the eyes of the street (again, thinking across UK as a whole, not just London which is world onto itself).\n\n5.  Diversity of government through sheer size.  This is one that's hard for Europeans to grasp.  In a lot of ways, you have to talk State by State (e.g. compare California to the UK, not the whole of the US).  When you're in the US, you realize so much of quality of life depends on your city and state.  This doesn't make international news.\n\n6.  If you have a job, \"spending it all on health insurance\" is a bit of an overblow.  My family's net (taking into account taxes on one hand, health insurance on the other side, including childbirth) is comparable on both sides.  The point of Obamacare is to make sure that's relatively true for everyone, we'll see if that works.  There are stories of injustice that make the news, but they're not as prevalent as the headlines would make out (just as NHS horror storries aren't as prevalent as certain UK newspapers would lead you to believe).\n\n7.  Property.  You can do much more with your property without planning permissions.  Also love the DIY culture in the states that doesn't exist in Europe.\n\nI'm not an exceptionalist by any means, and I think so much depends on your exact situation.  But these are some specific things that are really good about living here.\n\nEdits: grammar.\n\nEdit2: My wife disagrees with me on point (3) for the poor specifically; she thinks the gov support network makes it easier for the poor to take the first steps from poverty (on the road to Oxbridge or other success) than in the US, myth of the \"American Dream\" notwithstanding.  Very reasonable (and obviously controversial) point; considering giving her (and respondents and OP below) the \u2206 there.\n\nEdit3:  I approached this from a **personal advice** standpoint.  Like, if a friend had a job offer to come over, I'd be like \"come on!  A gun toter won't shoot you on every corner, in this city we all think the shutdown is stupid too, and you should be fine with healthcare with your employer, and hey: you can cut down your trees if you want\".  This is ***not*** the advice I'd give to a poor immigrant, nor is it to trivialize the very real poverty etc. problems in the states. \n\n**tl;dr no place sucks as much as the newspapers would have you believe.**\n\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind"}]}

The one thing that many people don't realize is how the US came to be.  We are a true immigrant nation, and the people who came to the US dropped what little they had and spent days or even weeks on a ship risking death for opportunity.  This mind set can be considered independent and determined, and it seems to be passed down to the nation we know today.  We are adamant about our beliefs and we don't like handing things out on a silver platter, they need to be earned.  This is why health care and University are so exorbitant.
