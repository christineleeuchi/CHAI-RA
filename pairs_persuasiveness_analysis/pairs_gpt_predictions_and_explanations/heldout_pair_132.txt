Sure, here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument:

**Physically:**
- **Valence: 0.5** (The argument presents a balanced view, acknowledging the strength differences but also pointing out the importance of empathy as a valuable attribute.)
- **Dominance: 0.4** (The author challenges the notion of superiority based solely on physical strength, which adds a level of complexity.)
- **Intensity: 0.6** (The argument has a moderate intensity as it addresses a sensitive topic while also invoking comparisons that could provoke strong feelings.)
- **Concreteness: 0.5** (The argument uses specific examples (strength, empathy) but remains somewhat abstract in discussing the implications of these differences.)

**Workplace:**
- **Valence: 0.6** (The response is generally positive, citing personal experience to highlight the competence of women in traditionally male-dominated fields.)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (The author counters anecdotal evidence with their own experiences, promoting a more balanced discourse.)
- **Intensity: 0.7** (There is a strong intensity as the respondent passionately defends women's capabilities against what they see as a narrow view.)
- **Concreteness: 0.7** (This section includes specific examples of women excelling in technical fields, making it more concrete and relatable.)

**At home:**
- **Valence: 0.5** (The author seems to express a middle ground, suggesting differences in competencies without labeling one gender as superior to the other.)
- **Dominance: 0.4** (The author shifts the focus to a broader perspective on skills rather than gender-based superiority, but retains a somewhat questioning stance regarding conventional abilities.)
- **Intensity: 0.5** (This section is moderate in intensity, as it acknowledges varying skill sets without engaging in heated rhetoric.)
- **Concreteness: 0.6** (The mention of specific household tasks provides a level of concreteness, even if the argument remains somewhat general about competencies.) 

Overall, the argument provides a multifaceted perspective on a highly contested topic, balancing strength and competence with a broader understanding of diverse attributes across genders.

Here’s a breakdown of the argument you provided in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### 1. Valence
- **Score: 0.3**
- The argument carries a negative connotation towards women, implying inferiority in various domains (sports, workplace, home). The use of "not as good as men" and anecdotes suggesting incompetence contribute to a mostly negative valence.

### 2. Dominance
- **Score: 0.7**
- The argument is quite dominant in expressing the speaker’s views, making strong claims about gender differences in abilities. The speaker asserts their superiority in various contexts, which indicates a higher dominance level.

### 3. Intensity
- **Score: 0.6**
- The intensity is moderate to high, as the speaker conveys strong opinions and uses absolute statements (e.g., “99% of the plant workers are men”) and compares competence in personal anecdotes, making the argument feel forceful.

### 4. Concreteness
- **Score: 0.4**
- There are concrete examples given (anecdotes about personal experiences and industry statistics); however, these are largely anecdotal and lack broader empirical support. This reduces their overall effectiveness, leading to a lower score in concreteness.

Overall, this argument reflects a strong opinion but relies heavily on personal anecdotes and lacks a balanced view supported by a wider range of data or perspectives.
