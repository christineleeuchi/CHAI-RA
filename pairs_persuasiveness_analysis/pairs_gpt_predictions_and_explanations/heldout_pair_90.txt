Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings for the provided argument based on the requested criteria:

1. **Valence**:  
   - **Score**: 0.7  
   - **Rationale**: The argument expresses a negative viewpoint about the behaviors described, particularly the idea of someone "creeping" on another person's profile. However, it also acknowledges that the speaker understands the online context and seems to seek understanding rather than purely criticizing. 

2. **Dominance**:  
   - **Score**: 0.6  
   - **Rationale**: The argument asserts a clear perspective on social media behavior and how it should be perceived. It emphasizes the emotional impact of having someone reference old social media content. While it showcases the speaker's confidence in their viewpoint, it allows for the original argument to be considered.

3. **Intensity**:  
   - **Score**: 0.8  
   - **Rationale**: The use of phrases like "slightly violated feel" and the comparison to being recorded reflects a high level of emotional intensity. The argument evokes strong feelings about the implications of one's online presence and privacy, enhancing its overall intensity.

4. **Concreteness**:  
   - **Score**: 0.7  
   - **Rationale**: The argument uses relatable examples and metaphors, such as the analogy of a recording device and the notion of casually speaking to friends, which makes it easier to grasp. However, some abstract concepts about social media and personal feelings might leave a bit of room for ambiguity.

Overall, the argument presents a well-rounded perspective on the issue, balancing emotional and rational components effectively.
