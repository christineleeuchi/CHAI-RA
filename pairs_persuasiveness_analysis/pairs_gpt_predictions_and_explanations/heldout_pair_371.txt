To evaluate the argument provided, I will assess each quarter of the text on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

1. **Valence** (emotional value or tone):
   - *Score*: 0.8
   - The argument is presented with a strong critical tone toward the high-ranking officers at Nuremberg, suggesting a negative view of their actions and decisions. The emphasis on voluntary service implies moral culpability.

2. **Dominance** (the level of influence or control expressed):
   - *Score*: 0.9
   - The argument portrays the high-ranking officers as having significant power and control within the military structure, as they were the ones giving orders. Their authority and position within the SS suggest a clear dominance in their roles.

3. **Intensity** (the strength of the argument):
   - *Score*: 0.7
   - The argument has a moderate intensity. It firmly asserts that these individuals were not coerced into their positions and should bear responsibility. However, it lacks more emotional engagement that could drive higher intensity.

4. **Concreteness** (the clarity and specificity of the argument):
   - *Score*: 0.8
   - The statement is relatively concrete in its assertion about the voluntary nature of high-ranking officers in the SS and the lack of coercion. It provides a clear delineation of responsibility, though it could benefit from more detailed examples.

Overall, the argument is strong and compelling, particularly in its emphasis on the responsibility of high-ranking officials. Each aspect contributes to the understanding of accountability in the context of the Nuremberg trials.

**Dominance: 0.7**  
The speaker asserts a clear understanding of the legal framework, showcasing knowledge and authority over the subject matter.

**Intensity: 0.6**  
The argument has a solid intensity; it expresses confidence, but it remains somewhat measured and professional in tone rather than emotionally charged.

**Concreteness: 0.9**  
References to the London Charter and the concept of unconditional surrender provide tangible grounding, making the argument feel concrete and evidence-based.

### Second Quarter:
**Valence: 0.7**  
The focus on the status of the defendants adds a slightly positive tone regarding the legitimacy of the trials, though it’s somewhat factual.

**Dominance: 0.6**

**Intensity: 0.5**  
This part of the argument is factual and straightforward, lacking emotional intensity.

**Concreteness: 0.8**  
By highlighting that these were the top surviving leaders, the argument remains grounded and clear, providing a solid context for the preceding points.

### Third Quarter:
**Valence: 0.8**

**Intensity: 0.7**  
There is a higher intensity here as the speaker emphasizes duty and moral responsibility, invoking a strong sense of obligation.

**Concreteness: 0.8**  
The idea of soldiers having a duty to disobey illegal orders is a clear and concrete assertion that underscores the argument's moral foundation.

### Fourth Quarter:
**Valence: 0.6**  
The acknowledgment of the difficult moral position is empathetic yet suggests a harsh reality, making it somewhat neutral.

**Dominance: 0.5**  
This part offers a perspective that recognizes the complexity of the situation, but it does not assert strong authority or dominance.

The recognition of a “shitty position” adds a layer of emotional weight, but it’s somewhat tempered by the logical framework of the preceding arguments.
