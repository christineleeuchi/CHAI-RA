Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument provided, I will assign scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness based on each quarter of the text. 

### Quarter 1: "Shouldn't we try to fix the problems of rape, assault, and violence in prisons instead if suicide becomes that appealing an option?"
- **Valence (0.6):** The sentiment is mostly negative regarding prison conditions but has a positive slant toward finding solutions. 
- **Dominance (0.5):** The argument is questioning and seeks to assert that problems in prisons should be addressed, indicating a moderate level of dominance.
- **Intensity (0.6):** There is a strong emotional appeal in expressing concern for serious issues like rape and assault, giving this a moderately high intensity.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** The mention of specific issues makes the argument concrete in its context.

### Quarter 2: "I'm for physician assisted suicide in the cases of terminal illness myself..."
- **Valence (0.8):** This portion has a positive valence as it advocates for physician-assisted suicide in appropriate cases.
- **Dominance (0.4):** It presents a personal viewpoint without a strong assertion, indicating lower dominance.
- **Intensity (0.5):** The statement is moderate in intensity as it conveys a personal belief without strong emotions.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The concept of physician-assisted suicide is specific but is somewhat abstract in the context of terminal illness.

### Quarter 3: "...but I think saying 'Just let them kill themselves' will only lead to more apathy towards prison conditions."
- **Valence (0.5):** This segment has a neutral to slightly negative valence, indicating concern about potential consequences without overly negative emotions.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The speaker asserts a viewpoint that challenges a proposed solution, indicating moderate dominance.
- **Intensity (0.7):** The concern about apathy towards prison conditions adds intensity to this part of the argument.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** The phrase "just let them kill themselves" is concrete but operates at a more abstract level regarding societal attitudes.

### Quarter 4: "for each quarter of the argument's text."
- **Valence (0.5):** This segment is neutral, merely providing instruction and lacking emotive content.
- **Dominance (0.5):** It expresses no opinion, showing a neutral level of dominance.
- **Intensity (0.1):** This part has low intensity due to its instructional nature.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument's valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it down into four quarters:

1. **First Quarter: "A lot of prisoners go to prison on grounds I disagree with: three strikes, mandatory minimum..."**

   - **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; expresses disagreement but does not convey strong positive or negative emotions.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker asserts a viewpoint but doesn't demonstrate strong authority or control over the topic.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; there is a clear stance, but it's more of a general dissatisfaction than an emotionally charged statement.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Somewhat concrete; mentions specific concepts but lacks detailed examples.)

2. **Second Quarter: "The courts should have the final say in who gets what punishment."**

   - **Valence:** 0.6 (Somewhat positive; supports the judicial system and emphasizes a belief in its authority.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker presents a clear assertion about the role of courts, indicating a stronger stance.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; a straightforward assertion but not highly charged.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete; clearly defines the role of courts in the context of punishment.)

3. **Third Quarter: "Other than that, the State shouldn't be involved with suicide unless the State has to take on responsibility."**

   - **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; expresses a pragmatic viewpoint without strong emotional appeal.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced view; indicates the speaker's belief about the state's involvement but lacks assertiveness.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mild intensity; the argument is clear but not emotionally engaging.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat concrete; presents a clear stance on state involvement, but general.)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "I don't want to pay for widows."**

   - **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative; expresses a concern that implies financial burden and distaste for consequences.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate dominance; indicates a personal opinion on responsibility but does not take a strong authoritative tone.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity; expresses a strong emotional viewpoint regarding financial responsibilities.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Relatively concrete; directly states a concern about costs associated with consequences of state actions.)

Overall, these ratings reflect the varying strengths and clarity of the arguments presented in each quarter.
