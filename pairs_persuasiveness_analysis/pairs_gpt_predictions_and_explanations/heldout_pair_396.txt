Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument you provided, I'll break it down into four quarters and assign scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

**Quarter 1:** "I'd say that there's a notable exception to this principle, and that's when a person had to overcome a major social barrier to become the first whatever of their category."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The sentiment is somewhat positive as it acknowledges exceptions where achievements are specially significant.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker is suggesting a perspective rather than asserting authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The statement has moderate intensity as it introduces a nuanced view on a principle.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The argument begins abstractly but hints at a more concrete discussion.)

**Quarter 2:** "For example, Jackie Robinson and his whole team took a major risk to be the first baseball team with a black player."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (This is positive as it highlights a significant achievement and bravery.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The example shows knowledge but remains within a personal belief system rather than dominating.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (This quarter carries strong emotional resonance and gravitas about overcoming barriers.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (This part uses a clear, specific historical example that grounds the argument in reality.)

**Quarter 3:** "When we celebrate these people, we're celebrating the battles previous generations fought to bring us together."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The celebration aspect is positive, suggesting an uplifting, communal perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The statement is assertive but still maintains a sense of inclusivity rather than superiority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a moderate-to-high intensity in the emphasis on collective struggles and victories.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While there is a broad sentiment, it references past actions which gives some grounding but remains somewhat abstract.)

**Summary:**
1. Quarter 1: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.3, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
2. Quarter 2: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.9
3. Quarter 3: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6

This breakdown allows for a nuanced appreciation of each part of the argument based on the specified dimensions.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument based on the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text provided, here's a breakdown:

### 1. Quarter 1: "I think the reason that we do this is to recognize the person, remind us of our progress towards equality, as well as remind us that there was a time when that would not have been possible."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive sentiment, emphasizing recognition and progress)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (A bit assertive about the purpose behind recognition but open-ended)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity about the subject)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Some abstract concepts, but reference to concrete ideas like 'progress' and 'recognition')

### 2. Quarter 2: "Jackie Robinson was the first black player in Major League Baseball."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral statement of fact)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Straightforward assertion without much emphasis)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low intensity since itâ€™s a factual claim)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (High concreteness, specific individual and context)

### 3. Quarter 3: "It was something that was revolutionary in American sports and helped change the way black people were viewed by American society."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive and revolutionary sentiment)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Assertive in stating its importance)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity regarding the impact)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Mix of concrete and somewhat abstract societal views)

### 4. Quarter 4: "If we all pretended that he was just some other MLB player then he would be forgotten and we would forget how influential he was to equality. He was different, and the entire concept of whites playing baseball with blacks was different, and because of that, he serves as a reminder that we should all have equal rights."
- **Valence:** 0.9 (Highly positive emphasis on equality and remembrance)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Clear assertion of his importance and difference)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong emotional weight and urgency in the message)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While it references specific issues (race and equality), the discussion of influence is more abstract)

In summary:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.9
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.9, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.6
