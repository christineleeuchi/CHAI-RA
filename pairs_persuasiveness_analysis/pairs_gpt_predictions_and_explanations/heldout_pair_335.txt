Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the given argument on the specified dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—let's break it down into four quarters and assess each quarter accordingly.

**Quarter 1:**
"So, it's hard to actually know for sure how this will all play out. That's actually part of the reason this is bad - no one from any of the groups involved actually knows how this is going to affect his chances at a nomination, which means that at very least, this was reckless."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (negative outlook on the situation, indicating potential harm)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (neutral, as the speaker expresses uncertainty)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (moderate; expresses concern but not overwhelmingly strong)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (some concrete implications, but mostly abstract concerns about uncertainty)

**Quarter 2:**
"From a tactical point of view, their attack on one of their staunchest supporters potentially removes legitimacy from both them *and* him. If they were truly reasonable, why not just ask him to let them speak? If he was truly a supporter, then why would the group attack him? What else does he purport to support that he actually doesn't?"
- **Valence:** 0.4 (suggests a negative consequence to the group's actions)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (the speaker positions themselves as having a better understanding of the situation)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (more intense as it questions motives and legitimacy)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (some concrete examples presented, but still largely theoretical)

**Quarter 3:**
"When people don't know his name well enough to instantly associate it with his views, attacks like this make it look like he doesn't support the things that he claims to. Without name recognition, a lot of people won't know that it's a double Shyamalan, and he actually does support civil rights."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (mix of positive and negative implications; confusion can be detrimental)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (some assertion of knowledge, but still speculative)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (stronger emphasis on the negative impact of lack of name recognition)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (provides specific reasoning connected to public perception)

**Quarter 4:**
"It also makes him appear weak to the general public. Instead of standing firm, he's seen being bullied out by the very interests he supposedly serves. It's easy to say someone bows down to corporate interests or special interests, but it's far more visceral to actually *see* someone back down from a special interest group on a stage in front of a crowd."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (suggests weakness which is negative for the candidate)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (the argument asserts a strong opinion regarding public perception)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (very strong, emotionally charged language about weakness and bullying)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (concrete effects of public perception are discussed clearly)

**Summary Ratings:**
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating for each category based on the provided argument, broken down into four quarters:

1. **First Quarter: "The problem is that they are getting and will get plenty of backlash for what happened. Sanders is the largest supporter of their movement currently running and they decided to attack his rally. This doesn't paint them in the best of light and marginalizes a lot of the things they are trying to say."**
   - **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone is somewhat negative as it focuses on backlash and marginalization.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument presents a concern and critique but doesn't seem to attempt to assert dominance in a strong way.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a palpable concern about the implications of the actions, but it's not overly emotional.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument uses specific references (backlash, Sanders' support) but remains somewhat abstract in discussing the overall impact.)

2. **Second Quarter: "It would have served them better to attack another candidate with a much lesser position as it would do exactly what you said, force that issue to the front of their campaign."**
   - **Valence:** 0.6 (This part suggests a more strategic and constructive viewpoint, indicating a potentially better outcome.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is expressing an opinion on strategy rather than making assertive claims.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (The tone is relatively calm but carries a sense of missed opportunity.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (More concrete in terms of strategic advice, focusing on the effects of targeting other candidates.)

3. **Third Quarter: "This doesn't work as well for Sanders because we know what his plans are and he has support for it, but this would have been great against Hillary or Trump as they haven't put much focus on the issue and their response to it could sway many people's opinions on their campaigns."**
   - **Valence:** 0.4 (There’s a slight negative tone regarding the effectiveness of the actions against Sanders.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (Stronger assertiveness in discussing the effectiveness of addressing other candidates.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (The rationale is more logical and less emotive, maintaining tone.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.8 (More concrete evidence cited regarding the candidates' positions and potential impacts.)

4. **Fourth Quarter: Overall closing remarks on the effectiveness of targeting Sanders versus others. (Implicit)**
   - **Valence:** 0.5 (Strikes a neutral stance overall.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (Reflects on the argument but doesn’t assert dominance.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (Ending is reasoned, less emotionally charged.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concludes with assertions about strategy that are somewhat grounded.)

The scores reflect an evaluation based on the content provided, emphasizing the aspects of the argument as requested.
