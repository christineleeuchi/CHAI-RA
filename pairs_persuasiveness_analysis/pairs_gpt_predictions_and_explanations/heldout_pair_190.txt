Here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument based on the categories of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**1st Quarter: "Historically, that's what they used to do, sure. The (legitimate*) purpose of the military is and has always been to defend the public from foreign threats..."**
- **Valence**: 0.7 (The statement acknowledges the military's purpose but also hints at a certain skepticism regarding its current utility.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (There's a balanced view here; while acknowledging historical roles, it sets the stage for a more complex argument.)

**2nd Quarter: "But those sorts of threats aren't very common any more, are they? Modern threats are a good deal less complicated..."**
- **Valence**: 0.6 (A skeptical tone towards the current nature of threats is presented, implying a need for reassessment.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (This section challenges the military's traditional role, asserting that modern threats require a different approach.)
