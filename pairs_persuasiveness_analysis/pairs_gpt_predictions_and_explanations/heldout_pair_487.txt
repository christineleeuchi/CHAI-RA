Let’s break down the argument into four quarters and assess each one based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1: 
"If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it. A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The statement is somewhat positive, suggesting a collective effort, but it also carries some uncertainty.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (It makes a general claim about human determination without strong evidence or persuasive context; the dominance is moderate.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The intensity is mild; while it suggests urgency, it lacks emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The statements are fairly abstract; they rely on general assumptions about human behavior.)

### Quarter 2: 
"Right now we don't have a rocket capable of putting a large bomb on Earth escape trajectory. Throwing money at NASA won't get us an SLS instantly. Rockets take a long time to build and need lots of testing before actually flying."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (This part conveys a negative perspective, emphasizing current limitations, which adversely affects overall optimism.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (This assertion of technical limitations is quite strong and specific, making it a dominant point in the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (There’s a stronger intensity here due to the concrete assessment of current technology.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (It presents specific details about the current state of rocket development, lending to high concreteness.)

### Quarter 3: 
"I am not saying it is impossible or that we wouldn't be able to get a rocket ready to launch in time but as of now it is a real possibility."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (This part has a neutral tone, neither positive nor negative, offering a balanced perspective.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (It weakens the previous dominance somewhat by suggesting that while there are challenges, it’s not entirely hopeless.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; it conveys a realistic view but lacks urgency.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (It's somewhat abstract, offering a generalized statement without specific metrics or examples.)

### Quarter 4: 
"Of course, all the numbers depend on the size of the asteroid and amount of warning we have but we could easily get into a situation right now where we could not deflect an asteroid in time."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (This carries a mildly negative outlook on the risks involved.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (It asserts a significant concern regarding potential scenarios, making it a more dominant point.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There's a stronger tone of urgency in considering the potential consequences, increasing intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Some level of concreteness is provided by acknowledging variable factors, but it still remains somewhat abstract.)

These scores reflect a breakdown of the emotional and logical components present in each quarter of the argument, capturing the nuances of each part's impact.

Here's a rating for each of the requested categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) based on the argument you've presented, divided into quarters:

### First Quarter (Asteroid Sources and Warning Time)
- **Valence: 0.8** - The argument is mainly positive, suggesting that we can detect potential threats well in advance.
- **Dominance: 0.7** - The claim that there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt gives it a sense of authority, though it could be countered by the size of the solar system.
- **Intensity: 0.6** - The argument is moderately intense; while it expresses confidence in detection capabilities, it doesn't evoke extreme urgency.
- **Concreteness: 0.8** - The reference to specific celestial regions (Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud) adds a level of specificity and tangibility to the argument.

### Second Quarter (Nuclear Weapons Deflection)
- **Valence: 0.8** - This section presents a strong solution (nuclear deflection), suggesting a hopeful avenue for mitigating threats.
- **Dominance: 0.6** - While the argument about using nuclear weapons has a scientific basis, it could be challenged regarding effectiveness and consequences.
- **Intensity: 0.7** - The mention of "nudge" implies urgency, but the discussion is somewhat analytical rather than emotionally charged.
- **Concreteness: 0.7** - There is a good level of detail about how nuclear weapons could work for deflection, though it lacks specific examples or precedents.

### Third Quarter (Human Response to Imminent Impact)
- **Valence: 0.9** - The assumption that humanity would prioritize preventing catastrophic events is very positive and hopeful.
- **Dominance: 0.8** - This claim has a strong position, suggesting a collective human effort to address disasters when faced with imminent threat.
- **Intensity: 0.8** - The discussion of sacrifices (including potential human lives) raises the emotional stakes and adds intensity.
- **Concreteness: 0.7** - The argument includes a bit of speculation but outlines potential human actions to an extent, though it could benefit from more detailed scenarios.

### Fourth Quarter (Counterarguments)
- **Valence: 0.3** - The tone here is more negative, emphasizing skepticism about humanity's response and the feasibility of solutions.
- **Dominance: 0.4** - This section feels weaker in its authority compared to earlier arguments and is more speculative, focusing on possible drawbacks.
- **Intensity: 0.6** - Though it introduces doubt and recognizes challenges, it doesn’t elicit a strong emotional response compared to previous sections.
- **Concreteness: 0.6** - While it raises valid concerns, it mainly discusses generalities without detailed specifics, leading to a somewhat vague position.

Overall, the argument presents a compelling case, but counterarguments bring uncertainty into the narrative. The emphasis on detection capability and human innovation is more persuasive than the doubts introduced about skepticism towards scientific endeavors.
