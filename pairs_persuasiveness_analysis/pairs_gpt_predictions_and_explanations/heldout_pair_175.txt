Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings for the argument provided, broken down into four quarters:

1. **Valence:**
   - **Score: 0.4** 
   - The overall tone of the argument is somewhat critical and negative, emphasizing the issues with requiring perfection in political speech. However, there is a hint of concern for qualified individuals being excluded, which adds a slightly positive angle.

2. **Dominance:**
   - **Score: 0.5**
   - The argument presents a strong perspective but does not invoke aggressive or commanding language. It articulates a concern about the political climate and the implications of expecting perfection, making it moderately dominant in expressing the speaker's views.

3. **Intensity:**
   - **Score: 0.6**
   - The argument is intense in its concerns about the implications of a "perfect speech" standard and its effects on politics. Phrases like "really concerning" and questions regarding who gets involved in politics carry a stronger emotional weight.

4. **Concreteness:**
   - **Score: 0.5**
   - The argument uses abstract concepts regarding political behavior and social expectations but does reference specific populations (the rich, power-hungry individuals) and the consequences of these norms. However, it still leans more towards abstract reasoning than concrete examples.

Overall, the argument has a balanced yet critical stance towards political norms while emphasizing the need for inclusivity over perfection.

Here are the ratings for the argument based on the specified dimensions:

### 1. Valence (0.0 to 1.0):
- **Score: 0.7**  
The argument has a generally positive tone towards the idea of complex discourse and pushing back against media tendencies, but it does express frustration towards both media and political accountability, reflecting a mix of positive engagement and critical analysis.

### 2. Dominance (0.0 to 1.0):
- **Score: 0.6**  
The argument demonstrates a moderate level of dominance; it articulates a strong position on the need for complex discussions and accountability but does so in a way that encourages constructive discourse rather than purely exerting dominance over the opponent's views.

### 3. Intensity (0.0 to 1.0):
- **Score: 0.8**  
The intensity is high; the writer expresses strong feelings about the nature of political discourse, media responsibility, and the implications for democracy. There are passionate assertions about the complexity of the issues and the importance of accountability.

### 4. Concreteness (0.0 to 1.0):
- **Score: 0.5**  
While the argument presents specific issues (institutional racism, climate change, etc.) and the need for nuanced discussion, the abstract nature of some claims (e.g., the call for accountability and the criticism of media behavior) means that not everything is directly tied to specific, concrete examples or actions.

To summarize:
- Valence: 0.7
- Dominance: 0.6
- Intensity: 0.8
- Concreteness: 0.5
