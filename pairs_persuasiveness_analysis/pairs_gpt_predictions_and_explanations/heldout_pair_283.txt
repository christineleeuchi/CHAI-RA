Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide a rating score for each of the specified categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument, I will analyze the text fragment by fragment. 

### Quarter 1:
*Argument: "I would say there's too many variables at play to designate one type of person as normal as then too many people are outliers."*

- **Valence**: 0.5 (The statement is neutral; it expresses a viewpoint without strong positive or negative emotions.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker presents an opinion but does not assert authority or control over the discussion.)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (The language is mild, lacking strong emphatic terms.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The mention of "variables" is abstract, yet the idea of "outliers" provides a more tangible notion.)

### Quarter 2:
*Argument: "Take, for example, ethnicity. While the largest ethnicity group is Chinese, there are more non-Chinese as a whole, so how can an overall (in the scale of the global population) minority be considered 'normal'?"*

- **Valence**: 0.6 (There is a critical tone regarding the concept of 'normal,' suggesting a challenge to mainstream ideas.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The use of "Take, for example" indicates a guiding role, but it remains conversational.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The argument presents a strong point, but the phrasing is still measured.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The reference to ethnicity provides a clear and specific example that grounds the discussion.)

### Quarter 3:
*Argument: "Then, when you add in other factors, gender, handedness, hair colour, eye colour etc."*

- **Valence**: 0.4 (The statement maintains a neutral tone without emotional charge.)
- **Dominance**: 0.3 (The statement presents additional factors but lacks a commanding presence.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The mention of multiple factors adds complexity, yet the phrasing remains straightforward.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The listing of specific factors gives the argument a more concrete feel, though they remain somewhat general.)

### Quarter 4:
*Argument: "There actually very few 'normal' people which pretty much defeats the purpose."*

- **Valence**: 0.7 (There is a more definitive and critical tone here, suggesting frustration or disillusionment with the concept of 'normal.')
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The statement asserts a conclusion that can influence the reader's understanding of the term 'normal.')
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The phrase "defeats the purpose" carries stronger emotional weight and urgency.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The conclusion provides a clear and definitive stance on the argument.)

### Summary Ratings:
**Quarter 1:**
- Valence: 0.5 
- Dominance: 0.4 
- Intensity: 0.3 
- Concreteness: 0.6 

**Quarter 2:**
- Valence: 0.6 
- Dominance: 0.5 
- Intensity: 0.5 
- Concreteness: 0.7 

**Quarter 3:**
- Valence: 0.4 
- Dominance: 0.3 
- Intensity: 0.4 
- Concreteness: 0.6 

**Quarter 4:**
- Valence: 0.7 
- Dominance: 0.6 
- Intensity: 0.7 
- Concreteness: 0.7 

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the rating scores for each of the four dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) across the four quarters of the argument:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "You are looking at it on the wrong scale, across hundreds of animal species it is normal to find a small percentage of homosexual individuals, thus it is perfectly normal to find that a small percentage of humans are homosexual."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Moderately positive; the argument suggests a validation of homosexuality as normal.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Somewhat assertive, but it positions itself as correcting a misunderstanding rather than dominating the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Balanced intensity; presents a straightforward comparison without overly strong language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete examples are provided (animal species) to support the argument.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "Homosexual people do make up a small but significant percentage of humans, and when people say that it is not normal they do not mean it is not the norm, they mean it is not normative (as in the common and correct way of going about things)."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly positive; explains a common misunderstanding without leaning too heavily in one direction.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Assertive in clarifying terms but not overtly aggressive.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (A bit more intense due to the discussion of common versus normative.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Uses specific terms to clarify meanings but is still somewhat abstract.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "There are combinations of hair and eye colour that are less common than homosexuality; there is never any question of whether or not these are normal, normality only comes up when it is accompanied by a value judgement."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive; highlights inconsistency in how 'normality' is judged.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (A more assertive stance taken by comparing norms across different traits.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Higher intensity due to the stronger rhetorical argument being made.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Uses examples but still relies on a general discussion of 'normality.')

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Even if there were no distinction of normal vs normative then you are left having to find a demarcation for what percentage of a population does something have to be for it to be considered normal or not, and unless you have that clearly defined point and do not move it around to suit your value judgments, then you have no basis for throwing normal or abnormal around."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to slightly negative; critiques the lack of clear definitions around normality.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (More dominant; challenges the reader to consider the implications of their definitions.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity due to the questioning and challenging nature of the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Less concrete; relies on abstract reasoning and lacks specific examples to support claims.)

These scores are subjective and based on the given text, intended to provide a nuanced view of the argument's characteristics.
