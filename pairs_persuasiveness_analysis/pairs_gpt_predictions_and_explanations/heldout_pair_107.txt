Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s an evaluation on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the provided argument:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "The information that you describe, tips like 'travel in well-lit, well trafficed areas,' 'be aware of your surroundings,' 'don't travel alone,' etc., are helpful for preventing other crimes like mugging, which is more likely to occur."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral tone; acknowledges the utility of tips while setting up an argument against their application to rape.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Establishes a sense of authority by stating facts about crime prevalence.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mildly intense; the argument is based on factual assertions rather than emotional appeals.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Provides specific, tangible tips and establishes a clear contrast between different types of crime.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "This advice as a way to prevent rape is not practical. When you give these tips to women as ways to prevent rape, you are giving useful information to half of your population for a situation that is not very common. (Also, the advice is really obvious. People are naturally uneasy when alone in the dark.)"

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative tone; critiques the practicality and effectiveness of safety advice in the context of rape.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts their viewpoint but does so in a way that acknowledges common knowledge.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderately intense, especially when calling the advice "obvious," which diminishes the perceived value of the tips.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Makes clear claims about the nature of the advice but could benefit from more specificity regarding its flaws.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "Rape is overwhelmingly committed by someone the victim knows. The 'jumping out of the dark' type rape is rare compared to 'date' rape."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Mostly neutral; presents a factual statement that underscores the misperception surrounding rape.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong dominance; asserts statistical information that shapes the reader's understanding of the issue.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Less intense, focusing more on providing factual information rather than emotional arguments.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete; relies on recognized statistics which bolster the argument's foundation.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "You can't give tips on how not to be murdered; you can only teach people to think murder is wrong. Likewise, in order to prevent rape, you should teach people who have sex to be considerate of their partners' consent."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive focus on the solution, emphasizing education as a path forward.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Confidently asserts an alternative approach to preventing rape, shifting the responsibility from potential victims to offenders.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately intense; carries a moral weight that may resonate strongly with readers.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it outlines a clearer strategy for prevention, it lacks specificity about how this teaching should be implemented.)

These evaluations reflect the persuasive aspects of the argument and how each section contributes to the overall message.

Here’s a breakdown of the argument with suggested ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "Here's a different angle: No, anti-victim blaming culture is not suppressing rape prevention information. The common activist is smart enough to tell the difference between blaming the victim and telling people to be careful."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The text has a generally positive connotation, promoting awareness and distinction.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is assertive, presenting a counter-argument to a common belief.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The tone is moderate, not particularly emotional but clear.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument presents clear distinctions between concepts.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "The 'teach men not to rape' meme/campaign/trend is mainly focused on spreading education of consent in situations involving heavy drinking, drugs, and ambiguous/difficult to read situations."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (This portion supports an educational initiative, promoting positive change.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The tone is informative; there's less assertion compared to the first quarter.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (This text is factual and not very emotionally charged.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The statement is clear and specific about the focus of the campaign.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "As several people have already pointed out, rape is not very often a crime involving ambush and assault, at least not in this age." 

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; it's an observational statement without emotional bias.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker is referencing others' views, which lessens assertiveness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The language is calm, with little emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The statement presents a specific observation, but its generalization may be debatable.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "In summation, the only people for whom self-defense and rape prevention information is being suppressed are the ones spreading this information in toxic activist communities."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This part has a more negative connotation, potentially casting a critical view on certain activists.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker strongly asserts that suppression is occurring within certain groups.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (This portion is somewhat more passionate, expressing frustration.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The conclusion is more generalized and may require broader evidence to substantiate.)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
