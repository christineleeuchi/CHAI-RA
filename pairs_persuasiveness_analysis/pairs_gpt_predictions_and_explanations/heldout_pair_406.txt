To rate the argument across the indicated dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the text, we will define each term as follows:

1. **Valence**: Refers to the emotional value associated with the argument, whether it's positive or negative.
2. **Dominance**: Relates to the degree of control or authority expressed in the argument.
3. **Intensity**: Measures the strength or forcefulness of the argument's language and its emotional appeal.
4. **Concreteness**: Refers to the specificity and clarity of examples provided in the argument.

Now, let's break down the argument into quarters and assign scores accordingly:

### First Quarter:
**Text**: "The best way to convince you is to show you the abuses that have happened. The government is not a monolith: it is composed of ordinary people, people that are susceptible to corruption."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (The statement has a negative emotional tone, emphasizing the potential for corruption.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The argument is more about presenting a case rather than exerting control.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The language is moderate; it introduces an idea without strong emotional force.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (It sets the context but lacks specific examples at this point.)

### Second Quarter:
**Text**: "And corruption has happened in the past, and it will most certainly happen again in the future. Here's a link detailing abuse at the NSA: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/nsa-employee-spied-detection-internal-memo"

- **Valence**: 0.8 (The historical reference to corruption adds weight to the argument's negative emotional impact.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (It supports the stance but does not assert strong control.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The phrase "most certainly happen again" carries an intense sentiment.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Offers a specific example with a link for further investigation.)

### Third Quarter:
**Text**: "Here's a link about the time the FBI asked MLK to kill himself: http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/13/fbi-letter-to-mlk-shows-sinister-side-of-government-spying/20993537/"

- **Valence**: 0.9 (This is a highly negative example showcasing a severe abuse of power.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (This suggests a perspective of agency and will from the government, indicating a level of authority.)
- **Intensity**: 0.9 (Using a historical atrocity described in stark terms creates strong emotions.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (The specificity of the case clearly illustrates the point being made.)

### Fourth Quarter:
**Text**: "And here's the NSA spying on MLK: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/nsa-martin-luther-king-jr_n_3995150.html And here's the FBI's COINTELPRO, which targeted dissidents..."

- **Valence**: 0.8 (The examples provided continue to evoke a strong negative perspective towards government overreach.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (While it asserts a viewpoint, it remains supportive rather than dominating.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The language emphasizes abuses related to civil rights and government surveillance.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The argument is backed by multiple concrete examples, enhancing its persuasiveness.)

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the argument based on four dimensions: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, rated from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the argument's text.

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "Let me start by saying, I understand where you're coming from, and yes you bring some valid points. Why would any law-abiding citizen need to worry about government monitoring of the internet? I've heard some people compare it to the police, and that it is in our best interest."

- **Valence (0.5):** The tone is somewhat neutral; while acknowledging valid points, there are hints of skepticism.
- **Dominance (0.3):** The speaker is not taking a strong authoritative stance yet; more of an introductory phase.
- **Intensity (0.3):** The emotion is mild, as the speaker is starting to engage in a discussion rather than expressing strong feelings.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** Mention of valid points provides some concreteness, though the context remains fairly general.

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** "but there some major problems: For me personally, it worries me that by allowing the government to observe anyone's personal lives, at any time puts a lot of power into government hands, and opens even more doors for corruption and abuse of power."

- **Valence (0.2):** The tone shifts to negative as concerns are raised, expressing distrust toward government power.
- **Dominance (0.5):** The speaker starts to take a more dominant position by stating personal worries and concerns.
- **Intensity (0.6):** There is a noticeable increase in emotional weight as the speaker expresses worry and highlights corruption.
- **Concreteness (0.4):** The mention of "corruption and abuse of power" adds some specificity but remains somewhat abstract.

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** "As it stands, there is no one in to hold the government accountable. We have no clue how broad the spying is or how much of it happens. Who is there to say, 'hey, that's not right' or 'hey you're not really working for the better of the people'? No one really. That's a scary thought to me."

- **Valence (0.1):** Strongly negative; the concern for accountability and the uncertainty are emphasized.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The speaker asserts their viewpoint more strongly, questioning authority and raising alarms.
- **Intensity (0.7):** High emotional intensity, especially with the phrase "that's a scary thought," reflecting deep worry.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** The use of rhetorical questions gives a sense of urgency and calls for attention, bringing more clarity to the concerns.

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** "The other main issue is that it's not really working out too well. The FBI has admitted that they have not foiled any terrorist threats from spying on US citizens. The main point I'm trying to get at is that if we don't oppose this, then we are giving the US government a HUGE amount of power and pretty much giving it no limits to that power. Which is against everything America stands for (Limits and balances to power)."

- **Valence (0.1):** Very negative; the argument critiques the effectiveness and raises alarms about power imbalance.
- **Dominance (0.7):** The speaker is clearly taking a strong stand, opposing the current situation.
- **Intensity (0.8):** The argument's intensity peaks here, especially with the term "HUGE" and the mention of American principles.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** Citing the FBI's admission provides a tangible example, making the argument more concrete and grounded.

### Summary of Ratings:
1. **1st Quarter:** Valence (0.5), Dominance (0.3), Intensity (0.3), Concreteness (0.5)
2. **2nd Quarter:** Valence (0.2), Dominance (0.5), Intensity (0.6), Concreteness (0.4)
