Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here's a breakdown rating for each quarter of the argument you provided based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

1. **First Quarter: "Well how far into spending money should we take this whole thing? Should we not spend money researching vaccines and coming up with any sort of cure? Because if you necessitate the treatment of diseases or chronic illness to the old and not the young, it kind of undermines the whole point of making an equitable and healthy society anyway."**
   - **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone questions the premise but encourages a more equitable outlook, so it's somewhat positive.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is presenting a challenge to the original argument, establishing themselves as an equal voice.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a moderate level of intensity due to the questioning nature.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is somewhat abstract but discusses a real concern regarding equity in healthcare.)

2. **Second Quarter: "Here's some perspective: I was born with a terrible amount of allergies. I was a kid who missed plenty of school days and even became hospitalized over the respiratory infections as a result of my allergies."**
   - **Valence:** 0.5 (Sharing a personal experience adds a neutral perspective; it does not strongly sway positive or negative.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker positions themselves as a recipient of care, which may reduce some authoritative dominance.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (This segment is more anecdotal and reflects personal experience without heightened emotion.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This part is quite concrete, as it describes specific experiences.)

3. **Third Quarter: "After many attempts at finding the cause, eliminating the allergen, doctors found an effective treatment for me."**
   - **Valence:** 0.8 (This is a very positive sentiment as it describes a successful medical intervention.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts authority through personal success, reinforcing the importance of medical research.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (Positive tone indicates some emotional intensity but is more factual.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete due to the specific mention of treatment success and medical processes.)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "Now, by your logic, one of those times I was in the hospital, it would have been wise to just give up. The cause of my illness and the severity to which it affected my life couldn't be easily identified. But luckily, science and medicine kept steadily chugging along and they were able to identify the source of my condition (a rare and newly discovered thing) which has led to me living a full and vibrant life."**
   - **Valence:** 0.9 (Highly positive due to the successful outcomes of treatment and the support of science.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker takes a strong stance against giving up on treatment, establishing authority based on personal experience.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (There is a notable intensity in the affirmative tone of living a full life due to medical advancements.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Discusses tangible outcomes but is blended with reflection on the situation, making it somewhat abstract.)

In summary, the ratings reflect a progression from questioning the original argument to a strong affirmation of the importance of individual cases and medical progress.
