Sure! Here's the rating for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** *I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders.*I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.*

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The sentiment is generally positive; it expresses support for liberal values and social progress.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker is asserting their identity and beliefs, but it's not overly aggressive.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The excitement for marriage equality and support for marginalized voices indicates a moderate level of intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The statements are concrete with specific references to political beliefs and figures.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** *One of these things is not like the others. (100% with you on those first four, btw). And herein lies the problem that you're talking about. *Why* do you believe them, despite having only hearsay and no solid evidence to rely on?*

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This portion brings a questioning and critical tone, which reduces the overall positivity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is challenging the beliefs stated previously, taking a more assertive stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate as the speaker is questioning perspectives without being overly aggressive.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is somewhat abstract, as it discusses belief and evidence rather than specific instances.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** *Because you've conflated the idea of their victimhood with your own open-minded liberalness. You think that to question them would be to reject your *political* beliefs. That not taking them for their word would betray your principles. This is an ideological response; and psychologically speaking it is very similar to the reaction religiously devout people have to something that violates the rules of their religion...*

- **Valence:** 0.1 (This section has a negative valence as it critiques ideological thinking and equates it to religious extremism, which carries a derogatory tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker takes a strong position, asserting the idea that any questioning is equivalent to being a bad person.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity is high as the language used is quite charged and assertive, indicating strong emotions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.3 (The abstract nature of psychological comparisons and ideologies makes it less concrete.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** *The key is to step back from the labels, and from what you've been *told* to believe, and just start thinking about the foundational goals of social justice...*

- **Valence:** 0.8 (This part is positive, as it encourages a more constructive and rational approach to social issues.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (It adopts a more reflective stance and is less dominant than previous sections.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (It has a moderate intensity, rallying for thoughtfulness but without aggressive language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The call for stepping back and considering foundational goals is concrete in terms of suggesting a clear action.)
