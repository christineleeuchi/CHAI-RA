Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a scoring for the argument based on the given criteria:

1. **Valence (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.6**  
   The argument has a mostly negative valence, as it addresses the issue of hate and homophobia, which are negative concepts. However, it also conveys a more nuanced understanding of the roots of such biases, suggesting that individuals may not inherently possess hate, which adds a slightly positive aspect.

2. **Dominance (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.5**  
   The argument asserts a viewpoint on the nature of homophobia but does not aggressively dominate the discourse. It presents a counterargument to the notion of inherent hate, rather than trying to overpower other viewpoints, thus receiving a neutral score.

3. **Intensity (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.7**  
   The argument exhibits a moderately high intensity, reflecting strong emotions regarding the topic of homophobia and its underlying causes. The writer expresses a clear stance that conflicts with the idea of innate hate, which contributes to the intensity of the argument.

4. **Concreteness (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.4**  
   While the argument references societal and familial influences on biases, it lacks specific examples or empirical evidence to support its claims. Therefore, it is somewhat abstract, reducing its concreteness score.

In summary:  
- Valence: 0.6  
- Dominance: 0.5  
- Intensity: 0.7  
- Concreteness: 0.4

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Sure, I can provide a rating score for each of the four categories based on the argument provided. Here's the breakdown for each quarter of the argument:

1. **"willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know"**
   - **Valence:** 0.3 (The statement has a negative connotation due to the focus on hate.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (It expresses a relatable human condition but lacks strong authority.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (The emotion of hate is strong, but it's presented as a common bias.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The idea of “hate” is abstract but made concrete by the justification of lack of familiarity.)

2. **"Unfortunately that is just a very human, universal bias."**
   - **Valence:** 0.0 (This has a neutral connotation, indicating a general observation of human behavior.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.4 (It acknowledges the existence of the bias but doesn’t assert dominance.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.3 (It's a mild statement describing a common human trait.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The term "bias" is somewhat abstract but applicable to human experience.)

3. **"Every human experiences this bias."**
   - **Valence:** 0.0 (This is a neutral statement about human nature with no strong positive or negative sentiment.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (It asserts a universal truth but without an authoritative tone.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.2 (The claim is more factual than emotional.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (It is a clear assertion about human experience.)

4. **"What differentiates people is the ability to DEAL with that emotion."**
   - **Valence:** 0.4 (This has a slightly positive connotation, suggesting personal growth.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (It positions emotional management as a differentiator, which implies authority.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (There’s a moderate intensity in discussing the ability to deal with emotions.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The concept of "dealing with emotions" is more actionable and concrete.)

5. **"If anything, ex-homophobes have demonstrated this ability, so you know they are capable of logically defeating their own bias."**
   - **Valence:** 0.5 (This has a positive connotation in recognizing personal growth.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (It asserts that they have achieved a level of understanding and reasoning.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (There’s emotional weight in recognizing change and overcoming bias.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The statement relates to a specific group and their capacity for change.)

6. **"On the other hand, if you are looking for people who don't have any biases at all, you are probably excluding the entire humanity."**
   - **Valence:** 0.2 (This is mostly neutral, pointing out a common limitation of human nature.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (It presents a larger viewpoint but doesn't assert strong authority.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (It points to a truth about human biases but remains mild.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The message is clear about the universal nature of biases amongst humanity.)

Overall, throughout the argument, there is a balance of neutral observations about human behavior, a recognition of emotional challenges, and a mixture of acknowledgment of personal growth among ex-homophobes.
