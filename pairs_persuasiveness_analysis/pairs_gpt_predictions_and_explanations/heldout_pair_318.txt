Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here’s a rating for each quarter of the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone conveys some frustration or concern about circumcision, but isn’t overly negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The argument presents personal insight but is positioned within a broader debate, making it somewhat less dominant.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There’s a moderate intensity in the expression of newfound awareness regarding circumcision.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The mention of studies suggests a level of evidence that provides concrete support for the argument.)

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (This quarter has a stronger negative valence, critiquing circumcision and its proponents, particularly Brian Morris.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (This section continues to challenge previous statements, asserting a more dominant stance against circumcision.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The intensity increases as it presents detailed information that disputes previously stated views.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Links to positions taken by various medical organizations provide concrete evidence and credibility to the argument.)

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (There is a clear negative valence related to the psychological impacts of circumcision.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (This section takes a stronger stance through the introduction of studies and the implications of psychological damage.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (References to cortisol levels and psychological effects present a more intense argument against circumcision.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Concrete studies and their findings increase the argument's solidity.)

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.8 (There’s a strong positive valence regarding the experience of uncircumcised men, contrasting strongly with the earlier views on circumcision.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The anecdote strongly asserts a perspective that favors intact males, making it a dominant part of the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The personal account of sexual pleasure is highly intense and evocative.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While the anecdote provides insight, it is still subjective and less concrete than empirical data.)

Overall, the argument develops progressively in intensity and valence, especially as it transitions to personal testimony that supports a strong stance against circumcision and advocates for the intact experience.

To provide the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for the given argument regarding circumcision and autism, we will analyze the overall tone, authority, emotional impact, and clarity of the argument. 

1. **Valence (0.5)**: The valence is neutral to slightly negative. While the argument presents a viewpoint that questions the legitimacy of certain studies, it does not evoke strong emotional responses. It is focused on presenting skepticism rather than generating strong positive or negative feelings.

2. **Dominance (0.6)**: The argument asserts a degree of dominance as it takes a critical stance against the meta-analysis studies that support circumcision's lack of impact on sexual satisfaction. The references to various studies and critiques demonstrate an attempt to position the author as knowledgeable and critical, indicating a moderate level of dominance in the discourse.

3. **Intensity (0.4)**: The intensity of the argument is relatively low. The argument is analytical rather than passionate or aggressive. While it addresses significant aspects of the circumcision discourse, it does so in a calm, measured tone, reducing its overall intensity.

4. **Concreteness (0.7)**: The argument is fairly concrete, given that it references multiple studies, statistics, and specific critiques, which lend it a sense of grounding in empirical data. However, the complexity of the argument and the reliance on external studies may reduce its immediate accessibility for some audiences, though it remains clearer than a purely abstract argument.

In summary:

- **Valence**: 0.5
- **Dominance**: 0.6
- **Intensity**: 0.4
- **Concreteness**: 0.7
