Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here’s a rating score for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "Sex is biological. Gender is how one's biology and actions interact with society. Gender exists, just as much as democracy and popularity."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Neutral to positive; the argument is generally factual and descriptive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The author asserts a clear stance on sex and gender, providing a sense of authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The tone is moderate; it’s assertive without being overly passionate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Concrete definitions and comparisons to concepts like democracy and popularity enhance understanding.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "Each society over history has handled gender in different ways, and it changes over time. In the west for the past decade or so the view of gender had become increasingly complex."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive acknowledgment of change and complexity in societal views.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (While still assertive, it is more observational concerning societal shifts.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Maintains a moderate tone, emphasizing observation rather than emotional engagement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Historical references lend tangible context to the argument.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "As you pointed out, intersex is a real thing, it is physically obvious something is in a gray zone there. Mental differences between sexes are just as biologically real, and the right combo of hormones and development history can lead to mixing of self-perceived gender as well."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive engagement with the concept of intersex and mental differences.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Confidently discusses biological realities, asserting the complexity of gender.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (A bit more intense with the acknowledgment of complexities in biology and identity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Referencing biological and physiological elements adds strong concreteness.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "For most of history such people had to hide from persecution, but now in many places we can have real dialogue about it. This is hopefully leading to a society where people can live without fear or oppression regardless of their perceived or believed gender."
- **Valence:** 0.9 (Strongly positive, highlighting hope and progress.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The tone is more about hope and dialogue rather than assertion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Conveys emotion regarding oppression and the desire for positive change.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (While offering predictions about societal change, it is somewhat less concrete than earlier points.)

These ratings reflect the overall tone and content of each section of the argument.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the requested categories—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—based on the provided argument, broken down by quarter:

### Quarter 1:
*"I'm not a very spiritual person. And I don't believe in a lot 'outside' of what we can perceive. Yes I believe there's more to the world, but I don't believe in anything beyond biological sex. Of course it's not binary. Intersex people very obviously exist, that's just scientific fact."*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to somewhat negative due to skepticism towards non-physical claims)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (A moderate level of assertiveness in the claim about biological sex)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Expressions of strong conviction but with a degree of neutrality)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (High concreteness with references to intersex as scientific fact)

### Quarter 2:
*"I'm having trouble understanding what exactly your view is, as I'm sure you'll understand seeing as you acknowledged that it's rather vague and complicated. But your use of the word 'spiritual' is intriguing and I think that might be where the 'problem' (if I can use that word) with your view is."*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Slightly negative due to the mention of 'problem' but generally inquisitive)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less dominant as it questions rather than asserts)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity with curiosity and slight criticism)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Moderate, as it reflects understanding while seeking clarification)

### Quarter 3:
*"Your use of 'spiritual' seems to imply that you see gender (as opposed to biological sex, although I disagree with that distinction for other reasons) as a *metaphysical* concept. This isn't the case, at least in most academic circles: it's a *social* concept."*

- **Valence:** 0.2 (More critical of the other view, indicating a negative valence)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (More assertive as it outlines disagreement and presents an alternative view)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Higher intensity in the declaration of how gender is perceived)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Moderate to high, as it discusses concepts within academic circles)

### Quarter 4:
*"You seem to have empiricist leanings, but I feel like you've taken that a step beyond what is reasonable: although there is something inherently anti-empirical about metaphysical or spiritual claims, and so an empiricist would be sceptical of them, you've extended this scepticism to all non-physical claims, which isn't reasonable since there's clearly plenty of social and mental phenomena which are empirical but not physical. Take art, for instance. It's pretty clear that there is no essential physical property to what we call 'art', but that doesn't mean we can't study art and make objective statements about art beyond its physical attributes (we can talk about the role of art in society, or the history of art, or what art is influential etc.)"*

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Some criticism directed towards the opposing view, but with a constructive focus)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (A strong assertiveness in arguing against the other viewpoint)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity due to the complexity of the argument and its implications)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (High concreteness as it uses a relatable example to support the argument)

These ratings reflect an analysis of the argument's emotional tone, assertiveness, strength of expression, and the degree to which it deals with tangible concepts.
