To assess the argument "Suffering isn't the default, doing stuff is" based on the requested dimensions, we will break it down into four quarters and rate each one in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1: "Suffering isn't the default, doing stuff is."
- **Valence:** 0.5 – Neutral. The premise is somewhat negative (suffering) versus somewhat positive (doing), but it does not strongly lean towards either side.
- **Dominance:** 0.4 – This statement feels more like an assertion, implying a lack of control over one’s situation (lack of dominance).
- **Intensity:** 0.4 – The intensity is moderate; it doesn’t evoke a strong emotional response but rather presents a clear statement.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 – The concepts are abstract (suffering vs. doing) but are still relatable and understandable.

### Quarter 2: "Millions of years ago, we did shit to survive. We hunted woolly mammoths and looked for berries and stuff."
- **Valence:** 0.6 – The reference to historical survival is somewhat positive, emphasizing human agency and activity.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 – The idea of survival through action suggests a strong sense of control and dominance over their environment.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 – This evokes a strong image of struggle and determination, thus having higher intensity.
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 – The imagery of hunting and gathering is very concrete and tangible.

### Quarter 3: "As time went on we discovered farming and we settled down, so we didn't need to do as much..."
- **Valence:** 0.6 – This section reflects progress and adaptation, suggesting a positive shift in human activity.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 – There’s a greater sense of control with advancements in farming and settling down, though not complete dominance.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 – Moderate intensity as it describes historical progress without evoking extreme feelings.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 – The concepts are grounded in historical developments that can be easily visualized.

### Quarter 4: "My point is that it is not the default to be bored, we have just been spoiled as a species."
- **Valence:** 0.4 – The idea of being spoiled has a negative connotation; however, it also suggests a recognition of past achievements, somewhat balancing out.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 – This statement implies a reflection or realization rather than a commanding presence. It shows some awareness of choice but not full control.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 – There’s a moderate intensity as it conveys a realization about human nature and societal changes.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 – While the concept is clear, "spoiled" is slightly abstract and can be interpreted in different ways.

### Summary Ratings

1. **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.5 | Dominance 0.4 | Intensity 0.4 | Concreteness 0.6
2. **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.6 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.7 | Concreteness 0.8
3. **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.6 | Dominance 0.6 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.7
