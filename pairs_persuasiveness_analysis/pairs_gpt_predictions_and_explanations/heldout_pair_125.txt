- **Dominance (0.5)**: The speaker is presenting an analytical perspective.
- **Intensity (0.3)**: Low intensity as it's a setup for reasoning.

- **Concreteness (0.8)**: Very concrete with a real-life scenario and choices outlined.

### Quarter 4:
**Text: "Therefore, if we put aside reasons for arguing for or against victim protection, it is possible that arguing against victims protecting themselves produces a safer outcome."**

- **Dominance (0.7)**: The speaker asserts a conclusion, indicating a higher level of dominance.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: Moderate intensity as it draws a potentially controversial conclusion.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: Somewhat concrete, but relies on assumptions about behavior and outcomes.

To evaluate the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can analyze each quarter of the argument text:

### 1st Quarter:
- **Valence** (0.7): The tone is critical of societal norms that place responsibility on women, indicating a negative view of victim-blaming.
- **Dominance** (0.6): The speaker assumes a position of authority in discussing societal impacts and argues against adapting to a "Dystopian society."
- **Intensity** (0.6): The language conveys a strong sentiment against the expectation for women to adapt behavior based on fear of false accusations.
- **Concreteness** (0.5): The argument references general notions of societal expectations but lacks specific examples or data.

### 2nd Quarter:
- **Valence** (0.7): Continuing the critical tone towards misconceptions about rape.
- **Dominance** (0.6): The speaker asserts that the common beliefs about rape are misleading, positioning themselves as knowledgeable about the issue.
- **Intensity** (0.5): While the sentiment here is strong, the specific intensity is lower as the phrasing is more explanatory than emotional.
- **Concreteness** (0.6): Introduces specific points about the nature of rapists and motivations, providing clearer ideas compared to the first quarter.

### 3rd Quarter:
- **Valence** (0.8): Strongly negative toward victim blaming, emphasizing how it creates an endless cycle of safety expectations for women.

- **Intensity** (0.7): The strong language about the limits of victim blaming reflects heightened emotional intensity.
- **Concreteness** (0.6): The argument begins to elaborate on the slippery slope of victim blaming, which adds depth to the analysis but still lacks specific examples.

- **Dominance** (0.8): The speaker firmly positions themselves against the normalization of victim-blaming narratives.
- **Intensity** (0.8): The urgency of the language and the call to recognize existing societal issues signifies high emotional investment.
- **Concreteness** (0.7): More explicit assertions about women already knowing how to protect themselves lead to a more grounded argument.
