Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here are the ratings for the provided argument:

1. **Valence: 0.3** - The argument presents a somewhat negative view of English and its shortcomings compared to synthetic languages. There's an underlying frustration towards the challenges of teaching new languages and the dominance of English, which gives it a slightly negative valence.

2. **Dominance: 0.4** - The argument conveys a sense of authority on the topic by discussing the shortcomings of English and comparing it to other languages. However, it also reflects an acknowledgment of the practical challenges associated with changing the lingua franca, suggesting a more balanced dominance rather than an overpowering stance.

3. **Intensity: 0.6** - The argument passionately critiques English and highlights the difficulties of language change. The use of phrases like "a plethora of synthetic languages all better designed" and references to the common dissatisfaction with 'meh' languages conveys a higher intensity in expressing dissatisfaction.

4. **Concreteness: 0.5** - The argument is moderately concrete; it references specific points (such as some examples of programming languages) and practical challenges associated with changing languages. However, it remains somewhat abstract when discussing the qualities of synthetic languages and the overall evaluation of languages, making it less concrete than it could be.

Overall, the argument showcases a mix of personal insight and general observation, reflecting its multifaceted nature.
