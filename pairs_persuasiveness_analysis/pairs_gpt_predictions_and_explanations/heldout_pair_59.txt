Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of these four categories, breaking it down into four quarters.

**Quarter 1:**
*Really, to say "there is only black and white" is just as wrong as saying "there is no black and white - only grey". Because if black and white exist - grey must also. And if grey exists, so must black and white! You can't have grey without its mix of black and white.*

- **Valence:** 0.8 (This quarter establishes a positive tone by advocating for the coexistence of black, white, and grey.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts their perspective but does not overpower opposing views.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The argument presents a strong assertion about the interdependency of black, white, and grey.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (The concepts are clear and straightforward, focusing on the relationships between the colors.)

**Quarter 2:**
*What a person sees - whether black/white/grey (or roygbiv!) is a function of their knowledge and understanding. They might claim there is no black and white for a number of reasons. If what is right or wrong to them seems morally confusing, they might say black and white don't exist - because that's what life feels like to them. Or if a person believes he is not the cause of his actions he might say black/white don't exist, believing that life is a series of predetermined or random events we have no control over. Or a person might believe philosophically that right and wrong are all a matter of subjective or cultural perspective.*

- **Valence:** 0.7 (This section acknowledges varying perspectives, maintaining a balanced tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is presenting their thoughts without dominating the discourse.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument has a moderate intensity as it discusses different viewpoints.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The argument is articulated with clear ideas about perspectives on morality and understanding.)

**Quarter 3:**
*There *are* plenty of difficult choices with moral implications to make in life that you will not immediately know what the right thing to do is. E.g. should you live with your father or mother if they split up and you believe you love them equally? What's the right thing to do? For the moment of uncertainty, you may acknowledge the existence of grey.*

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The tone remains thoughtful and introspective, which is positive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The section poses questions rather than asserting dominance in perspective.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; it invites contemplation rather than strong emotion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Examples provided help clarify the idea of difficult moral choices.)

**Quarter 4:**
*Now to your example: if you have exhausted all other options and your baby is dying, should you steal to save its life? You said that stealing was bad/black, and saving your baby was good/white. Are you sure? You can't morally evaluate a particular choice *in isolation* of the context, the reasons, cause and effect, means and ends. In a certain context like in this example, stealing *is* the absolute, objectively right *moral* choice. Stealing is *right*! (Others may call it grey - you may call it black. But I believe it's 100% objectively white). In an emergency context, what is right and wrong must be re-arranged as a temporary measure so that the good survives. Of course, after the baby is saved, the father is still morally obliged to pay back what he has stolen.*

- **Valence:** 0.9 (This quarter has a strong positive endorsement of a particular moral stance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker asserts a strong viewpoint, effectively dominating the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (The intensity is high as it deals with an emergency moral dilemma with urgent stakes.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The argument remains clear and explicit in discussing a specific moral situation.)

Overall, the argument presents a thoughtful exploration of moral complexity, balancing between black and white views and embracing the nuances of grey areas.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument on **valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness** for each quarter of the text, here is the breakdown:

### Quarter 1: 
**Text Excerpt:** "The Universe can't be divided into good and bad because 'good' and 'bad' are just descriptions of how parts of that universe, interact with humans on a subjective level."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The argument is neutral in tone; it challenges a binary view instead of promoting a 'good' or 'bad' perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument presents a thoughtful perspective, asserting a level of control through intellectual analysis.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (It's moderately intense, inviting contemplation but not overly emotional.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Concepts are abstract but rooted in tangible human experience.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text Excerpt:** "We can express this interaction in more complex ways, and we can measure and relate this feeling to other, less subjective criteria, like temperature for warmth and coefficient of friction/ and description of material surface and its interaction with other materials."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Remains neutral as it focuses on measurement rather than moral judgment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Displays a strong authority in discussing complex relationships in a measurable manner.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Less intense, as it dives into a more factual analysis of interactions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Highly concrete with references to measurable properties.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text Excerpt:** "Is tickling bad or good? Well answering which category to put that in could be either an easy choice, or a very difficult one, depending on any brains subjective and unique experience of it."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Presents a playful example, engaging readers but still ambiguous about good and bad.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced perspective; doesn't claim supremacy over the right answer.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Invokes curiosity and personal reflection; slightly more intense.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Brings a relatable example, making the argument more tangible.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text Excerpt:** "But isn't it also obvious that, due to the fact that the transition between warmth and cold is a continuous scale, and the criteria is inherently subjective... there exists a very large grey area while attempting to jam everything into those two categories."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Maintains neutrality; focuses on the complexity of categorization without moral bias.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Affirms the author's viewpoint with confidence.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Higher intensity, emphasizing the complexity of concepts presented.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument is still somewhat abstract but uses relatable analogies.)

### Summary Ratings:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6 

These scores reflect the argument's nuances in language, complexity, and approach to topic.
