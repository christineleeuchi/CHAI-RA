Here’s a rating for each of the categories you requested for the different sections of the argument:

### 1. "I don't necessarily 'have nothing to hide', but I don't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook (or what porn I look at)."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly positive; the speaker expresses some comfort but acknowledges a risk.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker seems to reflect a personal opinion and perspective, but also indicates awareness of broader implications.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument feels moderate in intensity; it presents a personal viewpoint but discusses a significant concern.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument is somewhat concrete as it references specific platforms.)

### 2. "I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Slightly negative; the speaker supports the concept but seems to acknowledge an underlying concern.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (This point has more strength since it proposes a specific belief about the effect of government surveillance.)

### 3. "There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications."

- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument is concrete as it references specific context concerning ISIS and foreign fighters.)

### 4. "I'm not worried about the government knowing my political views."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (This section leans towards negative; it downplays the concerns of privacy.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This point has weaker dominance, as it attempts to dismiss privacy concerns entirely.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low intensity; the speaker appears to be dismissive of the issue.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat concrete in framing the discussion about political views, but not as strong as other sections.)
