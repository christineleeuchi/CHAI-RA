Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating score for each of the four categories for the argument presented:

1. **Valence (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.3**  
   - The tone of the argument is somewhat negative towards golf, highlighting a perception of it being less skilled compared to other sports. This contributes to a low valence score.

2. **Dominance (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.6**  
   - The argument expresses a strong personal opinion asserting that golf takes less skill, demonstrating an authoritative stance in the context of comparing sports. Although it might not completely overpower other viewpoints, it maintains a level of dominance.

3. **Intensity (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.5**  
   - The argument provides a reasonable intensity by using a definitive structure to express an opinion. However, it lacks extreme emotional loading or strong language; thus, the score reflects a moderate intensity.

4. **Concreteness (0.0 to 1.0)**: **0.7**  
   - The argument specifies particular aspects of golf (hitting a ball, aiming for a hole), which makes it more tangible. The comparison with other sports illustrates elements of skill, adding to the argument's concreteness.

### Summary:
- Valence: 0.3
- Dominance: 0.6
- Intensity: 0.5
- Concreteness: 0.7

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Sure! Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the specified aspects of the argument, evaluated in quarters of the text:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "Hitting a golf ball is one of the hardest things to do in sports. I don't mean hitting it well either, I mean just getting the head of the club on the ball. Especially the driver. I mean. Have you ever tried hitting a golf ball? It's flippin' hard."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The statement has a positive valence towards the difficulty of golf, highlighting the challenge involved.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion about the difficulty of hitting a golf ball, indicating a high level of confidence in their argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The use of phrases like "flippin' hard" conveys strong emotion and intensity in the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While discussing hitting the ball provides a tangible example, it doesn't include further specific details about the mechanics involved.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "Much less hitting it with any sort of accuracy. Much less the different types of shots you need to be able to do well."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (This section reinforces the argument about difficulty but has a slightly lower positive connotation as it focuses on the challenges rather than accomplishments.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument continues to assert the difficulties, but it's less forceful than the first quarter.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There is still a significant sense of intensity as it reiterates the challenges involved in golf.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Discussing accuracy and different types of shots adds some detail but lacks specific examples of what those shots entail.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "And often times with your feet well below or above the object you're trying to hit."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The statement objectively describes another challenge without a strong emotional tone, creating a neutral valence.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This part of the text is a factual observation rather than a strong assertion of opinion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity drops as it discusses a physical condition without strong emotional language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This portion is quite concrete as it describes a specific situation that challenges golfers.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Make no doubt about it. Those guys are very good at what they do."

- **Valence:** 0.9 (This statement has a very positive valence, acknowledging the skill level of professional golfers.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker asserts their confidence in the exceptional skills of golfers, reinforcing their argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (While the intensity is still strong, it's slightly diminished compared to earlier quarters because it's more of a statement of acknowledgment.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This statement lacks specific examples of skill but emphasizes the overall high capability of golfers.)

### Summary:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.9, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6
