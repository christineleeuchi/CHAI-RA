Let's break down the argument into four quarters and score each aspect accordingly: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. 

**1st Quarter of the Argument:**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The argument presents a critical view on parenting but also shows a willingness to engage in dialogue, making it neutral rather than overwhelmingly positive or negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker is asserting their perspective that respect should be earned, which suggests a moderate level of dominance in the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The phrasing like "total cop out" indicates a stronger emotional reaction, conveying some intensity in the point being made.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument references a specific situation—parental guidance—but lacks concrete examples to exemplify the points made so far.)

**2nd Quarter of the Argument:**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone remains critical but acknowledges a two-way street regarding respect, introducing some balance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker continues to assert their viewpoint but allows for consideration of the parent’s side, reflecting a bit more balance in dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity remains steady as the speaker engages with the counterpoint, though it is less emotionally charged than the first quarter.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The mention of mutual respect and the idea of understanding lays a clearer conceptual framework for the discussion.)

**3rd Quarter of the Argument:**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The argument’s tone leans toward a critical view of child understanding and responsibility, suggesting a negative perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a strong position regarding parental responsibility, indicating a higher level of dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The language used conveys a growing urgency and concern about behavioral expectations, increasing intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument starts generalizing about parental responsibility without concrete examples, making it somewhat abstract.)

**4th Quarter of the Argument:**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This section aligns with a practical view of authority and respect, showing a slight shift toward a neutral stance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument strongly asserts the expectation of following orders in authority contexts, showcasing a high level of dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The comparisons to police and employer relationships elevate the emotional weight and urgency, leading to a stronger intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This quarter provides specific examples from authority figures, making it more concrete, though still tied to broader ideas.)

**Summary of Scores:**
- **1st Quarter:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
- **2nd Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6
- **3rd Quarter:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5
- **4th Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.6

Overall, the argument reflects the complexities of respect in parent-child dynamics, authority, and communication.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Given the excerpt of the argument, I can provide a rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness as follows:

1. **Valence (0.6)**: The argument presents a balanced view but leans towards recognizing the value of parental authority and the time and investment parents put into raising children. It acknowledges that respect can be earned but also suggests there are circumstances (provision of care) where some level of respect is warranted. Overall, the tone is mixed but generally positive toward parental efforts.

2. **Dominance (0.5)**: The argument recognizes the authority of parents and the idea that they can make rules that children may have to follow. However, it also discusses the importance of logical reasoning and communication between parents and children. Thus, it maintains a neutral stance on authority, reflecting both parent and child perspectives evenly.

3. **Intensity (0.7)**: The argument presents strong feelings regarding the dynamics between parents and children, emphasizing the emotional and practical implications of respect and authority. The mention of parents' investments in their children and the real-world lessons encountered in boss-subordinate relationships adds a level of intensity to the perspective shared.

4. **Concreteness (0.6)**: The argument includes clear examples (changing diapers, providing for children, workplace dynamics) that illustrate the points being made. However, some of the claims are more abstract, particularly the implications of respect and authority. Overall, the argument is fairly concrete but relies on some generalizations about parental expectations and responsibilities.
