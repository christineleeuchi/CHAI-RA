Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings based on the argument you provided, broken down by the quarters of the text:

### 1st Quarter: "In some cases yes I see where you are coming from, but I don't see it with Down syndrome."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The response acknowledges the opposing view but expresses disagreement regarding Down syndrome, indicating a somewhat neutral to slightly positive stance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker expresses a personal perspective but does not assert dominance; they recognize the other viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The expression is moderately intense as it begins to address the topic of Down syndrome.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The mention of Down syndrome without specific details makes it somewhat abstract.)

### 2nd Quarter: "These are people who don't have a significantly decreased lifespan, there isn't a lot of pain or discomfort associated with it..."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (This portion positively reframes Down syndrome, emphasizing the lack of severe negative effects.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker presents strong information but does not necessarily dominate the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (This section has greater intensity as it refutes a negative view by discussing positive aspects.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument provides information about lifespan and discomfort, making it more concrete.)

### 3rd Quarter: "...just in general people with Down syndrome can go on to live long healthy lives."
- **Valence:** 0.9 (The valence is very positive, emphasizing the potential for individuals with Down syndrome to live well.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It reinforces the argument but does not assert dominance over the opposing view.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (This part has a strong assertion about life quality, indicating confidence.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Specific outcomes (long, healthy lives) give this portion clarity and strength.)

### 4th Quarter: "If you are talking about situations where an infant only has weeks or months to live and that time was spent in agony then you would have more of a point IMO..."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (This introduces a conditional scenario that is relatively negative, but the speaker is still engaging in dialogue.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker here confidently acknowledges where the opposing view could hold validity, showing a nuanced understanding.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The intensity is moderate as it discusses a serious issue concerning suffering.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This part is concrete, referring specifically to a situation that could justify different considerations.)
