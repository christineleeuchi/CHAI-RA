Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
I will provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each dimension (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument text you provided.

### Quarter 1: "I feel as though I'm lying to myself."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (The statement expresses a negative feeling or internal conflict.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (It indicates a personal struggle, showing a sense of vulnerability.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The phrase conveys a strong emotional feelingâ€”feeling like one is "lying" suggests a significant internal conflict.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (It is somewhat abstract as it addresses feelings rather than concrete actions or situations.)

### Quarter 2: "Why? And what 'technical standpoint' are you referring to?"
- **Valence:** 0.0 (This is neutral in tone, expressing inquiry rather than emotion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The questioning nature indicates that the speaker is attempting to engage in a dialogue.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The intensity is low as it is more about seeking clarification.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This part is relatively concrete as it asks for specific explanations.)

### Quarter 3: "Gender is mostly a surface level set of assumptions we make about other people to orient which social norms we should apply when interacting with them."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Moderately positive; it suggests a perspective that could foster understanding.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The statement asserts the speaker's viewpoint, indicating a degree of control over the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (It presents a strong opinion but in a more analytical rather than emotional manner.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The statement is relatively clear and defines concepts associated with gender.)

### Quarter 4: "Sure, biology has some influence and in a *very* few realms, might be a concern, but in terms of how we treat people in a day-to-day environment there's no reason trans people are not their gender."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (This part is relatively positive, affirming the legitimacy of trans identities in social interactions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is presenting a strong assertion that supports their viewpoint, reinforcing their authority in the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The use of "sure" and "very few realms" suggests a passionate defense of a viewpoint.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This part is quite concrete as it discusses the practical aspects of social interaction and identity.)

These scores reflect the emotional tone, assertiveness, emotional impact, and clarity of each part of the argument presented.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here are the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the provided argument:

1. **Valence**: 0.3
   - The argument appears to have a negative valence, as it challenges the notion of gender identity by emphasizing biological differences, which might be interpreted as dismissive or invalidating to trans individuals' experiences.

2. **Dominance**: 0.7
   - The argument displays a high level of dominance, as it presents scientific studies and data to assert a particular perspective. It attempts to establish an authoritative stance on the topic, possibly seeking to dominate the conversation about gender identity with biological evidence.

3. **Intensity**: 0.6
   - The intensity is moderate to high; the use of scientific references and the definitive language used conveys a strong belief in the assertion being made. The argument engages with emotional implications regarding identity but does so through a factual lens.

4. **Concreteness**: 0.8
   - The argument is highly concrete, providing specific examples from scientific studies, including genetic differences and brain structure analysis. This grounding in empirical evidence lends it a concrete quality that is difficult to refute at face value.

These scores reflect the argument's characteristics based on the language, tone, and content presented.
