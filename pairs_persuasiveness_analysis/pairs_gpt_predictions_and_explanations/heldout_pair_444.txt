### Second Quarter: "Thompson's findings only showed an increased risk..."
- **Valence:** 0.9 (Again, this portion is framed negatively, indicating that Thompson's work has been misrepresented.)
- **Dominance:** 0.75 (There’s a clear assertion of expertise, but it doesn't dismiss Thompson entirely, which dampens authority slightly.)

- **Valence:** 0.85 (Positive portrayal of vaccines and their benefits; addresses and counters fears.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The argument positions vaccines as necessary and beneficial, displaying control over the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.75 (Strong but measured, the language encourages research and understanding.)

Sure! Here is an assessment of each quarter of the argument based on the requested criteria:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "Between whistle-blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The tone is negative, suggesting distrust in vaccine efficacy and safety.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker positions themselves as knowledgeable or aware of an issue that others are ignoring.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The use of phrases like "something sinister is afoot" conveys a strong emotional response.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (While specific names are mentioned, the argument lacks empirical evidence or clear examples to substantiate claims.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "The problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea. It is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment 'I am scared.'"

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Critiques the prior argument, suggesting inadequacy and fear but not overly aggressive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Attempts to establish authority by critiquing the first argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The tone is more analytical and less emotive.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Points out the lack of grounding in facts while providing a meta-assessment of the argument's structure.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "Whistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest. It doesn't mean that the whole system is better off gone. It only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge. I'm not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that Obama immediately granted William Thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we're not looking at a conspiracy. He spoke out and he was encouraged to do so."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly positive; acknowledges the role of whistle-blowers but argues against the conspiracy perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Attempts to maintain a balanced viewpoint while addressing specific claims.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (More factual and less charged than previous segments.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (References specific events and actions taken, adding clarity to the argument.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "As /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed the laziest CMV comment in history, there's more at stake than what you can plainly see. Specifically Herd Immunity. That means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent..."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive about herd immunity and the community benefit of vaccination.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Presents a well-supported argument with a focus on collective responsibility.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (While it's factual, there is a passionate undercurrent about the implications of vaccination.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Clear explanation of herd immunity with a strong logical basis and statistics referenced.)
