Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

1. **First Quarter: "Are you arguing that college is affordable, or more affordable than people imply? Because while I would agree that there is likely some exaggeration, for many people it is completely unaffordable."**
   - **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is critical but acknowledges potential exaggeration.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is questioning the argument but seems to also be open to discussion.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (The speaker expresses strong feelings about affordability.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (It presents a scenario but lacks specific examples or data.)

2. **Second Quarter: "Not everyone gets the best case scenario, and if you make less than $30,000 a year, then paying a minimum of a third of a year's pay on education is not feasible."**
   - **Valence:** 0.7 (The message conveys a sense of concern regarding affordability.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument is more assertive, emphasizing the difficulties of low-income individuals.)

   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mild in intensity; it doesn't carry much emotional weight.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Acknowledges alternatives, but does not elaborate on them.)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "And I don't know how considering alternatives to college is an argument for the affordability of colleges; yes college is cheap if I do not go to it and take an apprenticeship instead, but I don't know what it would have to do with this discussion."**
   - **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is somewhat skeptical or dismissive regarding the relevance of alternatives.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument tries to reclaim the focus on college affordability while questioning the relevance.)
