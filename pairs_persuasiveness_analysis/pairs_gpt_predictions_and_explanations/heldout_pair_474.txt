Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument's valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness in quarters, I'll break it down as follows:

### Quarter 1:
**Text**: "It's gonna sound harsh but this is a 'suck it up and deal with it' situation and seeing as you're turning 21 now, you got a lot more of those coming."
- **Valence**: 0.4 (The overall tone is somewhat negative, emphasizing a harsh reality without much positivity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker positions themselves as the authority, suggesting that they know what is best for the person.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The phrase "suck it up and deal with it" is a strong expression of the argument, implying urgency and seriousness.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (While it's clear in its instruction, the context of "dealing with it" may feel abstract without specific examples.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text**: "To start, I'll say that there's no reasoning out of such constraint. Some of them appear antiquated, some of them make no sense, but they exist nonetheless and failure to recognize them will have consequences."
- **Valence**: 0.3 (The text highlights a frustrating reality, contributing to a negative emotional tone.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong authoritative position on societal norms and constraints.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The statement about the consequences of ignoring these constraints adds a moderate level of intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The mention of "constraints" gives a sense of tangible rules, though the specifics are not detailed.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text**: "Now, these things basically boil down to two choices; doing the generally accepted (proper) thing and deal with the generally slight inconvenience or do as you please and deal with the ramification."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (This section has a neutral tone, presenting choices without heavy negativity or positivity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker outlines a duality but does not assert dominance. However, they are providing a guiding perspective.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (There's a moderate intensity as it clearly states the consequences of choices.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The distinction between the two choices provides a clear framework for understanding.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text**: "As I said, there's really no way to will yourself out of it. As for your peculiar situation, I think the difference between 30 and 40 is slight enough that you'll have a hard time noticing and you won't need to socialize with people you don't like too much if they're mingled out over 40 people."
- **Valence**: 0.4 (The tone suggests a resignation to the situation, which can be seen as slightly negative.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The speaker continues to guide the listener's perspective with moderate authority.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The phrase "you won't need to socialize" softens the intensity by reassuring the listener.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The specific comparison of numbers provides a concrete perspective on the situation.)

### Summary Ratings
