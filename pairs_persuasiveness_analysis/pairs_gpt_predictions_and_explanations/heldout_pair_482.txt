1. **Valence (0.6)**: The argument has a generally positive tone towards Qui-Gon's intentions, suggesting that his decision aligns with a greater understanding of Jedi doctrines and goals. However, it recognizes the moral complexity surrounding the issue of slavery, contributing to a somewhat ambivalent valence.

2. **Dominance (0.7)**: The argument displays a strong dominance, as it logically leads the reader to understand Qui-Gon's actions in the context of Jedi philosophy and training. It presents a clear perspective about the motivations behind Qui-Gon’s decisions and counters potential objections effectively.

3. **Intensity (0.6)**: The argument is moderately intense; it evokes thought about the implications of Qui-Gon's choices and the broader consequences for Anakin's path. It engages with emotional dimensions, particularly regarding familial ties and the consequences of Jedi training.

4. **Concreteness (0.5)**: The argument presents a mix of abstract concepts (like Jedi philosophy and emotional attachments) and specific narrative details (Qui-Gon’s decision-making and the potential implications for Anakin). However, it largely operates on a more theoretical level rather than providing concrete examples of the characters' emotions in action.

Overall, the argument is well-reasoned and provides a nuanced perspective on Qui-Gon's actions while engaging with complex themes around morality and duty within the Jedi Order.

Here's a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the provided argument, broken down into quarters:

### 1st Quarter:
**Valence: 0.6**  
The argument presents a moral dilemma—recognizing the immorality of slavery—while also acknowledging the complexities of choices dictated by "The Force." The valence is somewhat positive as it seeks to justify Qui-Gon's actions, albeit morally conflicting. 

**Dominance: 0.5**  
The argument presents a balanced view of Qui-Gon's moral decisions alongside the influences of fate and prophecy. It doesn't overly dominate the discussion but explores the nuances of choice versus destiny. 

**Intensity: 0.7**  
The intensity is relatively high, as it invokes strong feelings regarding morality and Qui-Gon's responsibilities as a Jedi. It emphasizes the seriousness of the situation but not to the point of overwhelming. 

**Concreteness: 0.5**  
The argument relies on abstract concepts like "fate" and "the Force," which may lack specific examples. The ideas are conceptual but not entirely grounded in concrete terms, resulting in a mid-level score. 

### 2nd Quarter:
**Valence: 0.7**  
The argument maintains a positive slant regarding Qui-Gon's intent, suggesting he had larger goals in mind for Anakin and the Jedi Order. 

**Dominance: 0.6**  
It starts to dominate the discussion by framing Qui-Gon's decision as a calculated choice influenced by larger forces at play, giving the argument a strong narrative direction. 

**Intensity: 0.8**  
The intensity increases as it discusses the potential repercussions of attachments for Anakin and how they affect his fate, making the emotional stakes higher. 

**Concreteness: 0.4**  
While it touches on themes of attachment, the arguments are still abstract concerning how these concepts play out within the narrative, leading to a lower score for concreteness.

### 3rd Quarter:
**Valence: 0.5**  
The argument remains ambivalent here, as it acknowledges both the moral implications and the deterministic nature of "The Force." It doesn't lean strongly towards a moral or immoral perspective but balances them. 

**Dominance: 0.7**  
The focus returns to Qui-Gon's motivations and the narrative driven by prophecy, capturing the dominant theme of necessity over morality in Qui-Gon's decision-making. 

**Intensity: 0.6**  
The argument’s emotional intensity is solid, exploring themes of sacrifice and necessity, though it still lacks a dramatic urgency that might propel the reader's response more forcefully. 

**Concreteness: 0.5**  
The ideas are fairly grounded as they assess Qui-Gon's reasoning. However, they remain partly philosophical, so the score balances between concrete examples and abstract reasoning.

### 4th Quarter:
**Valence: 0.8**  
This quarter emphasizes Qui-Gon’s broader vision and the potential fallout of different choices, suggesting a more profound good that justifies unpleasant decisions. The morally complex viewpoint increases the overall positivity regarding Qui-Gon's outlook. 

**Dominance: 0.8**  
The argument reaches a peak in demonstrating Qui-Gon’s perspective as larger than immediate moral choices, showing a significant level of dominance in discussing the overarching themes of fate and the Force. 

**Intensity: 0.9**  
The intensity peaks as it addresses the potential dangers of Anakin’s attachments vividly. It engages strong emotions regarding fate and personal tragedy, making it impactful. 

**Concreteness: 0.6**  
In this section, the mix of past events and their implications provides more solid references, though the final conclusions about destiny still rely on abstract interpretations, giving it a moderately high score in concreteness.

### Overall Summary:
1st Quarter: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.5
