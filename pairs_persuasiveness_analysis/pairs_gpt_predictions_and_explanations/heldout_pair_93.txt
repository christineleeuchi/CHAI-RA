   - **Valence (0.5)**: Neutral; there's a recognition of differences without strong positive or negative emotions attached.
   - **Dominance (0.4)**: Low; the speaker feels somewhat unsure and isn't asserting dominance in the argument.
   - **Intensity (0.3)**: Low; the language is mild and doesn’t convey strong emotions or excitement. 
   - **Concreteness (0.6)**: Medium; while the speaker points to specific bands, they don’t provide concrete examples yet.

   - **Dominance (0.5)**: Neutral; there’s a sense of collaboration rather than asserting superiority.

3. **Quarter 3: "I friggin love NWA and the Wu Tang but a LOT of people even ones who really like rap think most of the Wu Tang songs are weird and boring experimental nonsense... they've got over 100 tracks and maybe 20 of them are phenomenal while some of the others leave you scratching your head."**

   - **Dominance (0.5)**: Neutral; there's a personal opinion shared without dominance over the subject.

4. **Quarter 4: "Mostly for Punk / hardcore you're listening for a hook that grabs you. A lot of it is emotional resonance... My War by Black Flag absolutely falls in the category of Fast, loud, no melody... but it grabs you and holds you for the whole song if you've ever had a period in your life where you were just pissed off... It's actually really similar to gangsta rap... it's about a feeling... often one of anger or trying to get over on 'the system.'"**
   - **Valence (0.8)**: Positive; the speaker conveys a strong appreciation for emotional connection.
   - **Dominance (0.6)**: Medium; the speaker asserts insights about the genre which shows confidence in their understanding.
