Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the provided argument on the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break the argument into quarters and assess each component accordingly.

### Quarter 1:
*"Any time you find yourself using a microeconomics example to address a macroeconomics problem; you're *probably* making a mistake."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 – The statement has a neutral tone, indicating a cautionary perspective rather than a positive or negative sentiment.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 – The assertion implies a level of authority on the distinction between micro and macroeconomic concepts.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 – The use of "probably" softens the statement, indicating a moderate level of confidence without being overly assertive.
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 – The argument presents a general principle without specific examples or detailed evidence.

### Quarter 2:
*"The short answer is sustainability. The government is not in the business of moralizing but it is in the business of survival."*

- **Valence:** 0.6 – The mention of "sustainability" carries a positive connotation, while the discussion of government priorities implies a negative view of moralizing.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 – The author conveys a strong position about the role of government in terms of survival, suggesting a clear understanding of the issue.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 – The contrast between moralizing and survival indicates a firm perspective.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 – While the term "sustainability" is somewhat abstract, the assertion about government roles adds some clarity.

### Quarter 3:
*"Lets take Uber's request for the first 500K self driving Google cars as an example. Here we have a company run by *relatively* few people. With this acquisition alone, it will remove 500K jobs from the job market."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 – The statement is factual, presenting both a situation and its potential negative impact without emotional charge.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 – The use of a specific example lends authority to the argument, illustrating the author's command of the subject.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 – The prediction of job loss has a moderate intensity, emphasizing the seriousness of the issue but without strong emotional language.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 – The specific example of Uber and the number of jobs lost provides a clear, tangible illustration of the argument.

### Quarter 4:
*"Without a progressive tax system, there just won't be enough money to run the country. It’s not about morality or fairness. It has nothing to do with anything the politicians say to pander to one side or the other. It’s just survival."*

- **Valence:** 0.5 – This conclusion is again factual, though it posits a potential negative outcome if the situation is not addressed.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 – The finality of the statement conveys a strong belief in the importance of the issue at hand.
- **Intensity:** 0.8 – The urgency of the claim regarding survival indicates a high level of intensity.
