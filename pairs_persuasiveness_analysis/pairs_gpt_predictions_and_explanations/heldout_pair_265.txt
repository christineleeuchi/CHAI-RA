Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here’s a rating for each of the four dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of your argument:

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.4 - The argument presents a somewhat neutral tone regarding the exploitation of developing countries, suggesting that low costs could be seen as advantages rather than purely exploitative.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The speaker seems to assert a certain level of authority on the subject, presenting a counterintuitive perspective.
- **Intensity:** 0.3 - The intensity is relatively low since the argument is more analytical than emotionally charged.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The use of economic terminology gives it a degree of concreteness, though it lacks specific examples initially.

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.5 - This segment explores the complexity of currency dynamics without strong emotional weight, maintaining a balanced view.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - There is a greater sense of authority as specific examples (e.g., China's currency manipulation) are mentioned.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - The intensity remains moderate as the discussion revolves around economic mechanics rather than moral implications.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - The mention of China and specific economic actions helps illustrate points effectively.

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.6 - This section presents a more positive outlook on the economic relationships between developing nations and Western lifestyles.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The speaker reflects on economic realities but stops short of making definitive claims about dominance.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - There's a moderate intensity as it discusses market dynamics and their implications on consumer behavior.
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 - The specifics of GM’s strategy with Buick and the market in China provide strong concrete examples.

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.5 - The tone here acknowledges potential challenges without a strong emotional overtone.
- **Dominance:** 0.4 - There's a slight decline in dominance as the speaker questions the viability of universal economic equality.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - This section has a low intensity as it becomes more speculative about future outcomes.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - While the idea is clear, it lacks specific examples or details for a more robust argument.

These ratings reflect a subjective interpretation of your argument's presentation and may vary based on individual perspectives.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here's a rating for each quarter of the provided argument, using the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### 1st Quarter of the Argument:
**Text**: Countries go through a development life cycle. Initially, they are under-developed and poor, with low wages. However, those low wages are a competitive advantage, as goods can be produced cheaply there. So multinational companies move their factories there. 

- **Valence**: 0.4 (The argument presents a somewhat neutral perspective, as it acknowledges the low wages in a negative light but also frames them as a competitive advantage.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The tone is generally informative and presents a clear structure of how the development life cycle operates.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The argument conveys a moderate level of intensity as it discusses economic dynamics without overt emotional language.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The argument uses specific terms like “multinational companies” and “factories,” making it relatively concrete.)

### 2nd Quarter of the Argument:
**Text**: That abundance of new jobs, even if they're poorly paying from an international frame of reference, are better paying than what the people use to do. Then secondary industries pop up. Restaurants that cater to the factory works, for example. Some of those restaurants succeed, some fail. 

- **Valence**: 0.5 (It maintains a neutral to positive tone by stating that new jobs, despite being poorly paid, are better than the previous situation.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The argument is descriptive and does not assert a strong viewpoint, making it more neutral.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The language is straightforward and lacks strong emotional appeal, leading to lower intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The mention of specific examples, like restaurants catering to factory workers, enhances the concreteness.)

### 3rd Quarter of the Argument:
**Text**: Those who own the ones that succeed, make money. Also, people who succeed in the factory become managers. They send their kids to get better education than they received, and thus they get a better skill set. That better skill set from a more educated populace leads to more skilled labor. 

- **Valence**: 0.6 (This section leans more positive as it focuses on success and upward mobility through education.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The argument asserts that individuals can improve their circumstances over time, which is a dominant theme.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (While it presents an encouraging narrative, it remains relatively moderate in its expression.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The discussion of education and skill set development is quite concrete, though slightly abstract in terms of execution.)

### 4th Quarter of the Argument:
**Text**: More skilled labor leads to better-paying jobs, as now companies that require skilled labor will look to the country because even skilled labor will be cheaper there than elsewhere. Eventually, skilled labor becomes the comparative advantage for the country, and some other underdeveloped country becomes the low skill, low wage location. 

- **Valence**: 0.5 (The argument is largely neutral as it discusses comparative advantage without heavy emotional language.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The argument’s conclusion about economic cycles reflects a strong, decisive viewpoint regarding labor markets.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The consequences of changing labor dynamics are more pronounced here, increasing intensity somewhat.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (It alludes to the economic theory of comparative advantage but lacks specific examples in this final segment.)

### Summary Ratings:
1st Quarter: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6  
2nd Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.7  
3rd Quarter: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6  
4th Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
