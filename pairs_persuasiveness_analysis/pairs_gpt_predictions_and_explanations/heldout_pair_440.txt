Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Let's break down the argument into four quarters and provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter:

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:**
"I don't understand how definitively discriminatory actions cannot be considered racist"

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; expresses confusion rather than a strong opinion)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (Reflects a sense of questioning rather than asserting authority)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Mild intensity; confusion does not convey strong emotion)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Concrete in questioning a concept but lacks specific examples)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:**
"the issue is that 'racism' has a negative connotation because a specific attribute of a person has been used to oppress such people, black people (for example) have been subject to very harsh treatment because they were black."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Positive towards understanding racism but negative about the concept itself)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (More authoritative; explains a nuanced understanding of racism)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Stronger emotional weight, especially with mentions of "harsh treatment")
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Cites specific examples of oppression, making it concrete)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:**
"If this history wasn't involved, and people simply used race as a way to describe people (even if poorly), no one would care about racism."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (Neutral to slightly negative; indicating a critique of race usage)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Balanced; presents an argument but lacks assertiveness)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate; reflects contemplation but not strong emotion)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Some abstract reasoning but not many concrete examples)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:**
"since the oppressed can't systematically oppress the powerful, they can't be reverse racist in the true sense of the term racist."

- **Valence**: 0.8 (Positive acceptance of a viewpoint but negative towards reverse racism)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strongly asserts a position and clarifies a complex point)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (High emotional involvement in the issues of oppression)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (A clear argument, but still abstract in defining "true sense of racism")

This breakdown reflects the nuances in the language and concepts presented in the argument. Each quarter varies in its emotional tone (valence), the authority it asserts (dominance), the strength of feeling (intensity), and how specific it is (concreteness).

To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I’ll break it down into four quarters. Here’s a rating for each category:

### 1. First Quarter: "Racism is judging one race as superior to another, and discriminating against someone due to their race."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (The statement defines racism in a way that is clear and generally accepted, conveying a positive stance against discrimination.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The statement is factual and neutral, focusing on a definition rather than asserting dominance over another view.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; it presents a straightforward definition without strong emotional appeal.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (The definition is clear and easy to understand, making it very concrete.)

### 2. Second Quarter: "Using the term 'Reverse Racism' feeds the very concept that someone who is in privileged position cannot be treated in a racist manner."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (This suggests a negative view of the term "Reverse Racism," which detracts from a more nuanced understanding of racism.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (It asserts a viewpoint that challenges a commonly accepted term, pushing back against the concept in a way that suggests dominance in argumentation.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The intensity is moderate as it expresses a clear opinion against a term, implying a strong stance.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The argument is somewhat abstract, discussing the implications of terminology, but still fairly concrete in its critique.)

### 3. Third Quarter: "Ethnic Minorities can be racist, and Ethnic Majorities can be treated in a racist manner."
- **Valence**: 0.6 (This presents a more controversial claim that may be accepted by some and rejected by others, creating mixed valence.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Assertively challenges prevailing notions about who can be racist, demonstrating a strong position.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The statement embodies a strong assertion, conveying urgency in its challenge to stereotypes.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (While the argument states a clear point, it does not provide examples or evidence, making it somewhat less concrete.)

### 4. Fourth Quarter: "Power is not a component of racism that is a component of something called 'Institutional Racism.'"
- **Valence**: 0.4 (This can be seen as a negative assertion against the traditional views on racism and institutional racism, leading to a lower positive valence.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (It directly asserts a position that undermines established concepts in the discussion of racism, indicating a strong dominance.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The intensity is high as it attempts to redefine a key aspect of the racism debate, provoking critical thought.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The statement is abstract and might necessitate further explanation or examples to be fully understood, resulting in lower concreteness.)

### Summary Ratings:
1. First Quarter: Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.9
2. Second Quarter: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
3. Third Quarter: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.6
4. Fourth Quarter: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.5
