Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument based on the provided criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we'll first break down each section of the argument into quarters and then assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each criterion.

**Quarter 1:**
*The issue with taxes are the impact it has on the person you're taxing. Firstly, a 15% flat tax would be a significant decrease in tax revenues, so that's unrealistically low.*

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to negative tone, indicating concern about revenue loss).
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The argument acknowledges the impact on individuals but starts with a focus on revenue, implying concern for government viability).
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity as it questions the feasibility of a 15% flat tax).
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Specific mention of tax revenue but lacks detailed examples or statistics).
