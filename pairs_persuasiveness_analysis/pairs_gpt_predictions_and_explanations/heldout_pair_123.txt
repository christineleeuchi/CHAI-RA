Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here's a rating for the argument broken down into four sections:

### 1. Valence
- **Score: 0.7** 
  - The argument has a generally positive tone, emphasizing the idea that not all drivers of loud vehicles are inconsiderate. However, it acknowledges that some exist, blending positive and negative sentiments.

### 2. Dominance
- **Score: 0.6**
  - The argument asserts a position of some authority by suggesting constructive actions (lobbying local government) and presenting personal experience as evidence. It is somewhat dominant in its perspective but remains open to discussion of others' viewpoints.

### 3. Intensity
- **Score: 0.5** 
  - The intensity is moderate. The argument makes a serious point about generalizations but does not escalate to strong emotional appeals. The mention of being considerate tempers the overall intensity.

### 4. Concreteness
- **Score: 0.8**
  - The argument is concrete in its structure, providing specific examples of personal behavior (using resonators and being mindful in residential areas) and proposing actionable steps for addressing the noise issue. It grounds its claims in real-world experiences.

Overall, this argument is relatively balanced and reasoned while still addressing the concerns raised by OP.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the requested dimensions for each quarter of the argument provided:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "I own 3 cars with no catalytic converters and a high flow muffler and one car has no mufflers or anything. The reason I do this is because I am an enthusiast that has cars that are heavily modified."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is somewhat positive as it expresses passion for car modification, but the mention of loud vehicles has a negative connotation.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker expresses ownership and confidence in their choices, asserting their identity as an enthusiast.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The enthusiasm for car modification is present, but it's not particularly intense or emotionally charged.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The reference to specific modifications (catalytic converters, high flow muffler) adds clarity and specificity to the argument.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Restricted exhausts also restrict performance, especially on turbocharged cars. Cruising and at idle they are all not that bad, when you get on it they are loud."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative as it acknowledges the noise but focuses on performance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts knowledge about vehicle performance and demonstrates a level of authority on the issue.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a moderate intensity as it discusses performance impact, though still somewhat subdued.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This portion provides concrete examples of how modifications affect performance and noise levels.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "I don't do this because I'm an inconsiderate asshole, I do it because I like it, and most people modify their cars for their liking. I always drive down my own street at a low rpm because I am considerate of my neighbors."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This segment has a defensive tone, indicating an underlying negative sentiment about being labeled inconsiderate.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker attempts to reclaim authority by justifying their actions but seems slightly reactive to criticism.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The emphasis on being considerate and the contrast with the label of "asshole" creates a more intense emotional response.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is somewhat abstract in terms of consideration for neighbors without providing specific examples of actions taken.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "If you live near a busy street you have to live with the noise. People who modify their cars to be loud don't know that you have a baby that's trying to sleep when you're living next to a busy street. You can't expect people to be considerate of you just because you chose to have a kid and live where you do."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This section carries a dismissive and negative connotation, suggesting a lack of empathy towards those affected by noise.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker attempts to establish a position but seems to undermine the consideration by contrasting it with a perceived lack of obligation to be considerate.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is emotional intensity in the assertion that people should manage their expectations and in the acknowledgment of others’ situations.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While it introduces a concrete situation (living near a busy street), it still remains somewhat abstract regarding specific solutions or awareness of others’ situations.)

These ratings encapsulate the sentiments expressed throughout the argument, highlighting the nuances of the speaker's perspective on car modifications and noise.
