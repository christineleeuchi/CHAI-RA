Here's a rating for each aspect of the argument you provided, broken down into four quarters of the text:

### 1st Quarter of the Argument
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument acknowledges the economic perspective but emphasizes a more nuanced view of utility, leading to a moderately positive tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument positions itself against a rigid utilitarian view, asserting a moral stance, which is somewhat assertive.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; it critiques a viewpoint without resorting to extreme language or emotional appeals.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (While the argument presents abstract concepts related to utility and happiness, it lacks specific examples or concrete evidence in this section.)

### 2nd Quarter of the Argument
- **Valence:** 0.7 (This section focuses on the emotional and societal implications of the argument, increasing its positive valence.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Here, the argument strengthens its claims and becomes more critical of the original stance, asserting a moral high ground.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The intensity increases slightly with the introduction of the societal impact and loss of happiness.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While referencing Bentham adds some concreteness, the argument remains largely theoretical regarding the emotional impact.)

### 4th Quarter of the Argument
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument concludes by supporting the vulnerable, but the critique of population control introduces a slightly more negative aspect.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument presents a counterpoint to the original Malthusian argument but doesn't push as forcefully as previous sections.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity remains moderate, as it presents a calm and rational conclusion to the critique.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (This part has the least amount of concrete evidence or examples, relying more on philosophical discussion.)

### Summary:
- **1st Quarter:** Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
- **2nd Quarter:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
