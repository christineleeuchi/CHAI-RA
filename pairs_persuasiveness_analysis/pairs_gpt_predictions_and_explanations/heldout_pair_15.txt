Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the argument text you provided, I will break it down into four quarters, providing a score from 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high) for each criterion.

### First Quarter:
**Text**: "Are you objecting to anything beyond the specific wording used in the laws?"
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral inquiry; does not express strong positive or negative sentiment)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (It implies a challenge but does not assert control over the discussion)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (The language is mild and questioning)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (It's a specific question about objections)

### Second Quarter:
**Text**: "For example, if the government passed a law that said: 'Looking through all laws, we will replace the word "marriage (married, marrying, etc)" with "asdf (asdfd, asdfing, etc)" and make no further changes.'"
- **Valence**: 0.4 (More neutral, but includes a hypothetical that might evoke a bit of humor or frustration)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (It asserts a hypothetical scenario to clarify a point)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate intensity, somewhat absurd situation proposed)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The example is highly specific with clear terms)

### Third Quarter:
**Text**: "Would that cover all of your objections?"
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral again; seeks clarity)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (Questioning position lacks dominance but presses for input)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Moderate intensity; remains polite and open)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Directly addresses objections in a practical sense)

### Fourth Quarter:
**Text**: "If not, what's left to complain about that situation? If it does cover everything, then consider that 'marriage' is a legal term when used in the context of the law, and doesn't need to conform to common usage."
- **Valence**: 0.4 (Neutral but slightly critical of potential objections)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Presents a stronger argument about the nature of legal terminology)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderately intense; shifts to a more assertive tone)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Addresses the legal implications concretely)

### Summary of Scores:
1. **First Quarter**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6
2. **Second Quarter**: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.8
3. **Third Quarter**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6
4. **Fourth Quarter**: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.7

These scores reflect the nature of the debate and the framing of the argument within the provided text.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the provided argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it down into four quarters:

**Quarter 1: "don't you think a lot more people will put up a fight when they are suddenly 'unmarried' than who put up a fight about gay people being married?"**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This quarter suggests a concern and conflict, indicating a slightly negative sentiment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is posing a rhetorical question, aiming to assert an opinion but leaving room for debate.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a moderate urgency in the question regarding peopleâ€™s reactions.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The language is somewhat abstract but presents a clear idea about potential reactions.)

**Quarter 2: "I don't want to go out and hire a lawyer to do all the legal contracts necessary just so that my marriage exists again,"**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The speaker expresses frustration and a need for practicality, indicating a neutral-to-slightly negative tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts their perspective forcefully about the burdens of legalities.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There is significant emotion regarding the unnecessary burden of legal contracts.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This quarter is quite concrete, outlining a specific concern about legal requirements.)

**Quarter 3: "all so someone else doesn't get 'offended' that people not exactly like them are in a legal contract."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This quarter expresses frustration and criticism toward those who may oppose legal marriage for same-sex couples.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker positions themselves as someone who challenges the motives of the opposition.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (There is strong emotional language, indicating high intensity regarding feelings of unfairness and offense.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Though it addresses a social issue, it remains somewhat abstract regarding the specific groups being referenced.)

**Quarter 4: (implicit conclusion that reflects on the legality and social dynamics of marriage)**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The ending suggests a mix of acceptance and resignation about marriage.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It acknowledges the situation without firmly taking a side but implies that the resolution is needed.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a moderate intensity regarding the need for change in societal norms.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It provides a sense of the broader implications of the discussion, though remains slightly abstract.)

Overall, these evaluations capture the emotional and practical weight the argument carries as it navigates through the complexities of the marriage debate.
