Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating score for each aspect of the argument across the four quarters of the provided text:

### Quarter 1: 
**Argument:** "It's unscientific to NOT believe in the existence of alien life. We humans already developed here in the universe, proving that development of life in this universe is possible."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The argument is positively framed, focusing on the possibility of life.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It establishes a strong stance by contrasting belief in aliens with the assertion that it is unscientific to deny their existence.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Emotional intensity is moderate, stemming from the implication of foundational scientific reasoning.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The statement about humans developing life serves as a tangible example, though it doesn't provide extensive evidence.)

### Quarter 2: 
**Argument:** "We earth organisms are already 'proof' for life in the universe. If the laws of nature allowed for us to exist..."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The implication that we serve as 'proof' lends a very positive outlook on the potential for life.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It reinforces the argument by asserting humans as evidence, though it lacks a counterpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, reiterating a sense of confidence in human existence as supportive evidence.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The reference to Earth organisms as proof adds a degree of specificity that is somewhat measurable.)

### Quarter 3: 
**Argument:** "Science dictates that the hypothesis that is the most statistically likely is the correct one. Unless new data refutes that hypothesis."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Neutral tone; focuses on scientific methodology rather than an emotional appeal.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly asserts a scientific principle about hypotheses, giving authority to the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Less intensity here as it becomes more about logic and method than emotional or passionate reasoning.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Relies on established scientific methods, making it very concrete in the context of scientific discourse.)

### Quarter 4: 
**Argument:** "It's scientific to assume aliens do exist."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Affirms a positive belief in the existence of alien life, remaining optimistic.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong closing statement, asserting the claim with confidence.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate emotional intensity as it concludes the argument with a bold statement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While assertive, it is somewhat abstract, lacking specific supporting evidence or examples.)

### Summary Ratings:
- **Quarter 1: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6**
- **Quarter 2: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7**
- **Quarter 3: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.8**
- **Quarter 4: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.8, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5**

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument "I think the correct scientific approach is that they don’t exist" based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here’s a breakdown:

1. **Valence (0.6)**: The argument carries a slightly positive tone towards a scientific approach but is dismissive towards the opposite view (that aliens might exist). It suggests a sense of certainty in the assertion that aliens do not exist, which may alienate those who hold a differing view.

2. **Dominance (0.7)**: The statement asserts a strong position, claiming authority on the subject of the scientific approach to the existence of aliens. It dismissively suggests that any other viewpoint is incorrect, indicating a dominant stance in the debate.

3. **Intensity (0.5)**: The intensity of the argument is moderate; it reflects a strong opinion but does not include emotionally charged language or strong rhetoric. There is a conviction in the assertion, but it's presented in a somewhat dispassionate manner, maintaining a focus on scientific reasoning.

4. **Concreteness (0.4)**: The argument is abstract and lacks specific examples or evidence to support why the scientific approach should conclude that aliens don’t exist. While it reflects a viewpoint, it doesn't provide concrete details or scientific principles to back it up, making it less persuasive in an evidence-based context.

In summary:
- Valence: 0.6
- Dominance: 0.7
- Intensity: 0.5
- Concreteness: 0.4
