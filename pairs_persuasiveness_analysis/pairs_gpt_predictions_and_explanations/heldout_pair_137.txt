Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the characteristics of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break down the argument you've provided into four quarters and evaluate each aspect accordingly.

### Quarter 1: "At the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral tone, presenting factual information but implies a negative outcome).
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The statement sets a declarative tone but does not strongly assert authority or control).
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Mildly intense; describes a significant change but lacks emotional weight).
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Provides specific details about citizenship and national symbols).

### Quarter 2: "You've glossed over the absolute biggest deal breaker on the list."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; it criticizes without carrying an emotional charge, though it implies the argument made is weak).
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The commanding language implies authority and asserts that thereâ€™s a serious oversight).
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate intensity; emphasizes the importance of the point being raised without overwhelming emotion).
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Abstract concept of a 'deal breaker,' but lacks specific examples at this point).

### Quarter 3: "US currency is not measured by a gold standard. Our currency is based on speculation."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (Slightly negative as it highlights a potential flaw in the argument regarding currency integrity).
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (A more factual tone, presents knowledge without appearing overtly dominating).
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The concept of speculation conveys a sense of urgency and potential risk).
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Very concrete; directly explains the nature of currency and the implications of speculation).

### Quarter 4: "If the country is dissolved, the currency is reevaluated again. Upon reevaluation it is impossible for it to divide into even halves. The different parts synergize to create a result greater than the sum of its parts. The division would result in a plummet in both economies."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (Negative tone, suggesting dire consequences of division).
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Stronger assertive language indicating a firm belief in the projected outcome).
- **Intensity**: 0.9 (High intensity; argues strongly about the economic fallout of division).
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Clear arguments but slightly abstract when discussing synergy).

### Summary Scorecard:
1. **Quarter 1**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6
2. **Quarter 2**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.5
3. **Quarter 3**: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8
4. **Quarter 4**: Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.9, Concreteness: 0.7

These scores provide a relative assessment of how the argument is framed across these dimensions.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To provide a rating for the argument segmented into quarters, I'll evaluate valence (overall tone), dominance (assertiveness or authority), intensity (passion or emotional weight), and concreteness (specificity and clarity).

### Quarter 1: 
"The problem is that we aren't divided on a nice and neat state level. Have you seen the Purple America map?"

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The tone is generally critical of the initial argument while remaining analytical, which is somewhat neutral with a hint of negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The statement presents a strong counterpoint to the initial notion but doesn't assert a commanding presence.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The language is straightforward and lacks heightened emotional appeal.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The reference to the "Purple America" map makes the argument clear and grounded in visual evidence.)

### Quarter 2:
"You can have liberal districts (often but not always containing cities) inside of states that strongly disagree with them, or conservative districts (often but not always more rural) inside states that are seen as liberal..."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Still neutral to slightly critical as it explains the complexity of divisions without outright dismissal.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument is illustrated rather than asserted with authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The explanation is somewhat vivid in illustrating the complexities of demographics.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (The use of specific examples clarifies the argument considerably.)

### Quarter 3:
"So for example Northwest Oregon would want to be part of the 'United States,' but as soon as you get outside of the Multnomah/Clackamas region and Lane county the state would probably want to be 'America.'"

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The tone is strong in its critique, especially as it delves into specific examples.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Using specific examples gives more weight and assertiveness to the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The specificity adds a touch of urgency and importance to the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.95 (Very concrete with clear, relatable examples that illustrate the point directly.)

### Quarter 4:
"If we are dividing at the state level they will end up in the wrong ones, and after some adjustment likely get back to the sort of gridlock we have..."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (This part is more pessimistic, suggesting negative outcomes if the proposed division were to occur.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument presents a potential outcome effectively but doesn't dominate the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The implications of potential failure create a more intense emotional impact.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (While explaining the consequences, it remains less specific than previous examples.)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.8
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.9
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.95
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7
