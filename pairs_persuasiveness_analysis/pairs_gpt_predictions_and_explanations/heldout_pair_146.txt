Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Certainly! Below is the rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the requested dimensions across the provided argument. The argument is broken into four quarters for evaluation.

**Quarter 1:**
*Content: You've developed a theory based on your own family and community, and anecdotes from some national figures and events. But the question is, does the theory represent the majority of North American Jews.*
- **Valence: 0.6** (Neutral, with a slight inclination toward skepticism)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (The speaker presents questions rather than asserting dominance over the conversation)
- **Intensity: 0.4** (Moderate, as it raises a thoughtful inquiry)
- **Concreteness: 0.5** (Somewhat abstract, not specific about the theory yet)

**Quarter 2:**
*In my experience it does not, and I also see plenty of national figures that support my position, such as for example [Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Political_views), Jon Stewart, [Schulman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schulman#Activism), etc.; Jews are very active in the BDS movement; and there is of course [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street) and so forth.*
- **Valence: 0.7** (Positive toward their view, providing examples of support)
- **Dominance: 0.6** (Some assertion of their position with supporting evidence)
- **Intensity: 0.6** (The use of specific figures increases the intensity)
- **Concreteness: 0.7** (Relatively concrete due to the references to specific individuals and movements)

**Quarter 3:**
*Why is your experience different from mine? Well, you mentioned "my synagogue." It is very possible that your theory is right about more religious Jews, but a lot of Jews in the US are non-religious and never or almost never go to a synagogue. They are also much less supportive of Israel and far less likely to think Jews are persecuted.*
- **Valence: 0.6** (Neutral to slightly positive as it challenges an argument without hostility)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (Questioning the other viewpoint but balanced with acknowledgment)
- **Intensity: 0.5** (Moderately intense as it presents a contrasting view)
- **Concreteness: 0.6** (Concrete points about non-religious Jews and their perspectives)

**Quarter 4:**
*You might be right that the Jewish religion focuses a lot on persecution of Jews (which makes sense, it's how Jews survived), but it simply is [not a big factor in the lives of many or most Jews in North America today]: Even of Jews that consider themselves "strongly connected" to the Jewish religion, less than half belong to a synagogue. And more and more Jews just don't care about religion, considering themselves only "culturally Jewish", 20% in 1990 to 37% in 2008, and by now that number is even higher.*
- **Valence: 0.8** (Positive portrayal of the contemporary Jewish identity)
- **Dominance: 0.7** (Strongly asserts a viewpoint counter to the initial theory)
- **Intensity: 0.7** (Intensely challenging the initial perspective with data)
- **Concreteness: 0.8** (Highly concrete due to statistical references and specific trends)

These scores reflect an assessment of how each quarter conveys emotional tone (valence), power dynamics (dominance), emotional strength (intensity), and specificity of the content (concreteness) in relation to the argument presented.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here is the rating score for each of the four aspects of the provided argument, broken down by quarter:

1. **Valence (0.8)**: The overall sentiment of the argument is mostly positive towards the experiences of Jews and the rationality of their feelings. It acknowledges their history and the validity of their emotions.

2. **Dominance (0.6)**: The argument presents a clear perspective on the historical discrimination faced by Jews, highlighting their experiences and implying that these experiences contribute to a justified sense of persecution. However, it also leaves room for counterarguments, suggesting some balance.

3. **Intensity (0.7)**: The language used conveys a moderately strong feeling about the impacts of persecution and discrimination. The reference to personal stories and historical context adds emotional weight, making the intensity higher.

4. **Concreteness (0.9)**: The argument is quite concrete, as it refers to specific historical contexts and personal experiences (e.g., Jon Stewart's bullying). This specificity grounds the argument in tangible examples rather than abstract concepts. 

Overall, the argument effectively emphasizes the historical context and rationality behind feelings of persecution in the Jewish community.
