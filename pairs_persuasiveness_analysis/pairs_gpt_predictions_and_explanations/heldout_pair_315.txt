Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the argument, I will first divide the argument into four quarters and then assess each quarter based on the specified criteria.

### Quarter 1: "Dogs only eat poo if you leave poo lying around. That's a reason to not leave poo lying around, not a reason to get rid of a dog."
- **Valence: 0.8** (Positive; suggests a solution rather than a problem)
- **Dominance: 0.7** (Strong; asserts responsibility lies with the owner and not the dog)
- **Intensity: 0.6** (Moderate; conveys a practical approach)
- **Concreteness: 0.9** (High; uses a clear cause-and-effect statement)

### Quarter 2: "When you say 'you' shouldn't own a dog, do you mean specifically me? Because I don't live in Germany so my dog won't hump your leg on the bus or poop in your park. Those seem to be problems with Germany, not problems with dogs."
- **Valence: 0.7** (Neutral to positive; questions the context without being overtly negative)
- **Dominance: 0.6** (Moderate; challenges the generalization made in the original argument)
- **Intensity: 0.5** (Moderate; rhetorical questioning reduces intensity)
- **Concreteness: 0.8** (High; references specific behaviors in a clear context)

### Quarter 3: "Dogs sometimes kill people, but they also sometimes save people's lives."
- **Valence: 0.6** (Balanced; acknowledges both sides of the argument)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (Moderate; presents a contradiction but doesn't assert dominance)
- **Intensity: 0.6** (Moderate; emphasizes the dual role of dogs)
- **Concreteness: 0.7** (Concrete; presents specific outcomes clearly)

### Quarter 4: "It's true that he consumes resources and produces CO2, but by that reasoning, I shouldn't own anything."
- **Valence: 0.5** (Neutral; suggests a broader point about ownership)
- **Dominance: 0.4** (Low; somewhat defensive; does not strongly assert a point)
- **Intensity: 0.5** (Moderate; presents a philosophical argument)
- **Concreteness: 0.6** (Moderate; generalizes the argument about ownership)

### Summary of Scores:
1. **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.9
2. **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.8
3. **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
4. **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.6

These scores reflect the strengths and weaknesses in each segment of the argument while addressing the concerns raised in the original statement.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument based on the qualities of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it down into quarters and assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quality.

**Quarter 1: "What do you propose we do with dogs after we stop owning them?"**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (neutral; the question is more thought-provoking than positive or negative)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (the speaker is asserting dominance by challenging the other person's perspective)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (the tone is inquisitive, not particularly intense)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (the question is concrete but open-ended)

**Quarter 2: "Do we start killing millions of them daily?"**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (negative; suggests a harsh solution to the problem)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (assertive; strongly implies a criticism of the opposing view)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (high intensity due to the emotional weight of the subject)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (very concrete; the proposal suggests a clear but extreme action)

**Quarter 3: "If not then all your complaints will still exist, worse even."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (somewhat negative; implies that alternatives to dog ownership won't solve the problems)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (maintains assertiveness by arguing against the counter-argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (moderate intensity; conveys frustration)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (somewhat concrete; discusses the implications of not addressing the issue)

**Quarter 4: "Feral dogs with no reliable food source will attack people far more regularly and viciously, they will still be annoying and eat poo."**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (negative; emphasizes the dangers and nuisances posed by feral dogs)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (strongly suggests that the situation would worsen, reinforcing the speaker's position)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (high intensity as it evokes fear and strong negative feelings)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (very concrete; describes specific behaviors and outcomes)

1. **Quarter 1:**
   - Valence: 0.5
   - Dominance: 0.6
   - Intensity: 0.4
   - Concreteness: 0.5

2. **Quarter 2:**
   - Valence: 0.2
