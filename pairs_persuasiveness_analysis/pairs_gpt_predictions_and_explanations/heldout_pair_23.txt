Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating for each aspect of the argument as you've requested, broken down into quarters of the text:

**1st Quarter: "Language is one debate that is not exclusively grounded in structure. The *English* language slaps structure in the face and laughs."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 - The tone is somewhat playful and rebellious but carries a hint of disdain for structure, which could be interpreted negatively.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The statement asserts a viewpoint but does not dominate the discourse; it introduces the argument.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The use of "slaps structure in the face" adds some intensity, but it's not overwhelmingly forceful.
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 - The metaphorical expression reduces the concreteness; while it conveys a strong image, it lacks specific examples or clarity.

**2nd Quarter: "The pronunciation or acceptance of a new word just come down to use. How many people say one *vs* how many say another."**
- **Valence:** 0.7 - This section has a more neutral and factual tone, focusing on usage rather than emotion.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - It establishes the argument's core premise regarding language evolution and usage statistics.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - The argument is presented in a straightforward manner, without strong emotional appeal.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - It's a concrete argument based on observable language use, making it more relatable.

**3rd Quarter: "While the original, intended pronunciation for the word by its creator was jiff the average person interprets it as gift minus t."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 - This section has a factual tone but carries a slight undertone of humor or irony about the discrepancy.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - It reaffirms the argument but doesn't strongly push it forward; it's more of an explanatory statement.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The statement is balanced; it provides an anecdotal example but lacks a passionate tone.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - It uses a specific example (the pronunciation of "gif"), which adds to its concreteness, though it still relies on general usage.

**4th Quarter: "Keep in mind that the function that language serves is to communicate more easily. If rules conflict with that priority, they hurt the language."**
- **Valence:** 0.8 - This section has a positive valence regarding communication, emphasizing the purpose of language.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - The argument strongly emphasizes the fundamental purpose of language, making it central to the discussion.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - There's a moderate level of intensity as it argues against rules that hinder communication.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - This section is concrete, discussing language's practical function and implications for usage norms.

Overall, the argument presents a valuable perspective on language and its evolution, with varying emotional tones and strengths throughout different sections.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To rate the argument on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can utilize the following definitions:

1. **Valence**: The emotional value associated with the argument. Positive valence indicates agreement or support, while negative valence reflects disagreement or opposition.
2. **Dominance**: The forcefulness or assertiveness of the argument. A high dominance score indicates a strong presence in the discussion.
3. **Intensity**: The strength or fervor of the argument's claims. High intensity reflects strong convictions and passions.
4. **Concreteness**: The degree to which the argument relies on specific, tangible concepts versus abstract or vague ideas.

Now, let’s evaluate each quarter of the argument text.

**1st Quarter: "i mean the person who made .gif has said it's pronounced jif but that's the thing isn't it? jif is pronounced jif. we already have a spelling for that sound that brooks no arguments so it makes more sense for gif to be a different sound (with a hard g)"**
- **Valence**: 0.4 (A slight negative tone towards the pronunciation "jif")
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Assertively states the creator's pronunciation and positioning GIF as distinct)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity in presenting a logical case)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (References specific pronunciation and spelling)

**2nd Quarter: "if you wanted to spell gif as in gift how else would you spell it? an italian would write ghif to be fair, but i think most people would just write gif"**
- **Valence**: 0.4 (Maintains a negative stance towards the alternative pronunciations)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Poses a rhetorical question, but not overly forceful)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate intensity, but more explorative in nature)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Uses specific examples of spelling and cultural context)

**3rd Quarter: "gi- having a j sound is a rule in romance languages. giraffe in italian is giraffa. our word for giraffe is based on this and so follows the same rules."**
- **Valence**: 0.4 (Neutral with a slight inclination towards supporting a structured argument)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Emphasizes linguistic rules which lends credibility)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate, as it involves linguistic analysis)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Strongly concrete in examples and established rules)

**4th Quarter: "the words that aren't based off romance languages follow different rules (these are the ones like gift and girth) and we didn't get .gif from italy so why should we use italian pronunciation for it?"**
- **Valence**: 0.5 (More neutral; challenges the accepted view with a logical inquiry)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Asserts the argument for differentiation prominently)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Strong conviction in differentiating based on origins)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Utilizes specific examples and clear reasoning)

**Overall Ratings:**
- **Valence**: 0.43
- **Dominance**: 0.6
- **Intensity**: 0.53
- **Concreteness**: 0.7

These ratings reflect a nuanced argument that combines some emotional undertones while being assertive and grounded in specific examples and linguistic principles.
