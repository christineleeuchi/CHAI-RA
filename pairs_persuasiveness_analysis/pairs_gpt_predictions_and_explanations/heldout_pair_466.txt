Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here are the ratings for each of the quarters of the text:

### 1st Quarter:
**Valence: 0.7**  
The argument presents a neutral to positive view about the necessity of discounts for groups underrepresented in the movie-going audience. It highlights statistics that back up its claims, contributing to an overall favorable tone.

**Dominance: 0.6**  
The argument establishes a clear stance on why discounts for children under 12 and seniors are justified, but it also acknowledges the strong presence of teenagers in the audience, which might temper its dominance slightly.

**Intensity: 0.5**  
While the argument uses statistics to support its claims, it does so in a restrained manner. The intensity is moderate as it tries to balance facts with reasoning without being overly passionate.

**Concreteness: 0.7**  
The use of demographic statistics makes the argument relatively concrete. It provides clear numerical data to support its claims about the audience composition.

### 2nd Quarter: 
**Valence: 0.8**  
This section has a positive valence, emphasizing the benefits of discounted prices for families. It presents a clear rationale for why theaters should cater to families, increasing the appeal of the argument.

**Dominance: 0.7**  
The argument firmly establishes that families are more keenly aware of total costs, positioning itself as a strong justification for discounts. It effectively asserts the importance of family attendance without undermining other demographics.

**Intensity: 0.6**  
While the argument is compelling, the intensity remains moderate as it is more analytical in nature rather than emotionally charged.

**Concreteness: 0.7**  
The reference to different groups (families vs. teenagers) adds clarity. The explanation of cost perception comparisons makes it concrete and relatable for the audience.

### 3rd Quarter:
**Valence: 0.6**  
This section acknowledges a nuanced view that lower prices might attract families for movies that children may not fully appreciate. It is generally positive but introduces a more complex perspective, which might slightly lower the valence.

**Dominance: 0.5**  
The argument is outnumbered by the previous two quarters in terms of strength. It introduces a subjective viewpoint regarding children's understanding of films, making it weaker in dominance.

**Intensity: 0.6**  
The conclusion about children's appreciation carries some emotional weight, making it more intense than earlier portions. However, it still retains a rational tone rather than becoming overly impassioned.

**Concreteness: 0.5**  
The argument is less concrete here since it introduces a more subjective notion about appreciation rather than providing hard data or examples, thereby introducing a level of abstraction.

### Summary of Ratings
- 1st Quarter: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7
- 2nd Quarter: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.7
- 3rd Quarter: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument provided, I will break it down into four quarters and assign scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each segment.

### Quarter 1: "It's about attracting customers. If a parent is going to take their kids somewhere, cost will certainly be a factor."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (Positive, affirming the importance of cost in decision-making)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Establishes an argument about customer behavior, but not necessarily authoritative)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity; cost is a relevant concern but expressed simply)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Fairly concrete; it's relatable and understandable)

### Quarter 2: "If they have to pay full price for multiple tickets than it might make them choose somewhere else to go."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (Negative implication for full price; points out a potential loss of business)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Too conditional; relies on the assumption that cost will heavily influence choices)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Strongly conveys concern about the effect of pricing)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Concrete in its explanation; speaks directly to the influence of price on decision)

### Quarter 3: "By giving a discount for young kids they attract more business from parents."
- **Valence**: 0.9 (Very positive; advocates for discounts as a solution to attract customers)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (Strong assertion suggesting a viable business strategy)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (High intensity; clear connection between discounts and increased business)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Concrete suggestion with a clear outcome implied)

### Quarter 4: "13 or so is about the age kids start going to movies with friends instead of their parents. Sure they are still borrowing money from their parents, but now the few extra dollars for a ticket isn't as big of a deal since they are only paying for one ticket instead of 2 or 3 or however many kids they might have."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (Neutral to positive; describes a transition in behavior but does not strongly advocate for a change)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (More descriptive than commanding; offers context rather than a strong argument)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Less intense; a factual observation rather than a persuasive command)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Highly concrete; provides clear details on the age dynamics and financial implications)

### Summary Table:
| Quarter | Valence | Dominance | Intensity | Concreteness |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1       | 0.8     | 0.7       | 0.6       | 0.7          |
| 2       | 0.8     | 0.6       | 0.7       | 0.7          |
| 3       | 0.9     | 0.8       | 0.8       | 0.8          |
| 4       | 0.7     | 0.6       | 0.5       | 0.9          |

These scores reflect an analysis of how each segment contributes to the overall effectiveness of the argument in terms of emotional appeal, authoritative stance, emotional weight, and clarity.
