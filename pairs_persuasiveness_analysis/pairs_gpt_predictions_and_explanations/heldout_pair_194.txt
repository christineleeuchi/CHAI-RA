Here are the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument provided:

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence: 0.3** (The tone is somewhat negative as it critiques current methods of exile and public shaming, but it doesn't entirely dismiss their utility.)
- **Dominance: 0.4** (The author presents a good amount of knowledge, indicating a degree of authority, but relies on familiar societal concepts rather than asserting a strong forceful dominance.)
- **Intensity: 0.6** (The argument has a moderate intensity in highlighting the existing forms of exile and shaming, utilizing some strong language.)

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence: 0.2** (The tone is increasingly negative, as it outlines the detrimental effects of being an ex-con and reinforces that these practices lead to social exclusion.)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (There is a stronger assertion of authority here, as the argument details the adverse impacts of social exile, showing a clearer stance.)
- **Intensity: 0.7** (The intensity rises due to the implications of the consequences faced by ex-convicts, which are presented with urgency.)

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence: 0.3** (While acknowledging some potential problems with incarceration, the author maintains a negative perspective on the alternatives as well.)
- **Dominance: 0.7** (Here, the argument achieves a strong point of authority, especially when discussing psychiatric needs and alternatives to incarceration.)
