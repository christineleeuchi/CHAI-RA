Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument provided, we can break it down into four quarters and rate each quarter based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0. 

### Quarter 1
"I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The tone is somewhat negative, as it discusses suicide; however, it reflects a rational perspective.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker presents a strong opinion but acknowledges the complexity of the situation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; it expresses significant concern about decision-making around suicide.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The focus on research and effective methods adds some concreteness, but the discussion is still abstract regarding suicidal intent.)

### Quarter 2
"There's research that shows that [many suicide attempts are impulsive]. Lots of people make bad decisions during times of grief and/or stress. It is *not* a rational decision, just a very strong emotional response."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone remains negative, discussing impulsive and emotional responses related to suicide.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument is based on research, which strengthens the speaker's position, conveying authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (It has a higher intensity since it clearly states that impulsive decisions are linked to emotional distress.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Referencing research adds clarity and detail to the argument, providing a solid basis for the claims made.)

### Quarter 3
"And that's exactly where hotlines can help these people. In that moment of pain, they are suicidal."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (This part of the argument shifts slightly to a more positive viewpoint, highlighting the potential help from hotlines.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is advocating for the usefulness of hotlines, but it may not be as authoritative as empirical claims.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity level remains moderate, recognizing the pain while also emphasizing potential support.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The mention of hotlines as a potential help provides a concrete solution, making it relatable.)

### Quarter 4
"Your claim seems to be that only those people who have suffered for prolonged periods of time and decide to end their lives may be called suicidal. There is no way you can say that the suicidal wishes for anyone are legitimate based on how long they've suffered - what matters is intent, and often the action that follows it."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is more critical and confrontational, which could be interpreted negatively.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker challenges another viewpoint effectively, showcasing assertiveness in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The statement expresses a strong disagreement which elevates the emotional intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is conceptually concrete, addressing intent and actions, but still deals with abstract concepts of legitimacy and suffering.)

To provide a rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I will break it down as requested.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The sentiment primarily reflects a negative view on impulsive suicide; it carries a somber tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a clear opinion about the nature of suicidal thought, indicating a position of strength in their argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument has a considerable emotional weight, reflecting the serious and grave nature of the topic.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The mention of doing research and planning makes the argument quite specific and tangible.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "The desire to die doesn't necessarily negate the fear of death, although it may push it deeper into the subconscious."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This maintains a somber tone, touching on the complexities of suicidal feelings without outright negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (There is a level of insight being presented, but it does not assert dominance over the topic.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity due to the nuanced nature of discussing fear and desire.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It provides a specific perspective on the relationship between desire and fear but is more abstract.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "It's always seemed to me that people who call suicide hotlines (the 'long-term'/legitimately suicidal people) are trying to prove themselves wrong, to find some reason or way to avoid killing themselves."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (It presents a slightly more positive perspective on hotline users, implying hope or a search for alternatives, though still within a serious context.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is offering a personal theory, thus showing a good level of dominance in the thought process.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The statement carries emotional weight, acknowledging both the struggle and the potential for seeking help.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The metaphor of "proving themselves wrong" adds a conceptual clarity to the argument.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "The hotline may not change any external factors, but a truly rational suicidal person would, aside from the 'research' you mentioned, also seek out anybody who purports to be able to change his view."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The tone remains predominantly serious, reflecting a critical stance on the effectiveness of hotlines.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument asserts a strong perspective on rationality and the behavior of suicidal individuals.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a moderated emotional tone reflecting the complexities of rationality in suicidal thoughts, yet the seriousness of the subject still resonates.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This statement refers to rational behavior and seeking help, which are clear in intent but are abstract in nature.)

This breakdown provides a nuanced view of the emotional and psychological undercurrents present in each portion of the argument.
