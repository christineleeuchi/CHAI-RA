Here are the ratings for each of the specified categories based on the argument's text:

1. **Valence: 0.3**
   - The argument has a negative valence as it focuses on the perceived injustices and implications of mandatory vaccination, particularly concerning marginalized families. However, there is a level of concern for children's well-being and agency, which softens the negativity slightly.

2. **Dominance: 0.4**
