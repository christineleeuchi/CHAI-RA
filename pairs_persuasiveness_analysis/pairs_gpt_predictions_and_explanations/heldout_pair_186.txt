Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a breakdown of the argument into four quarters and a rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each:

### Quarter 1:
**Text**: "I don't know if you live in the US or in the EU or whatever. But I think you miss something very simple. There is value in learning a language that you can use, there is less value in learning a language that you won't use."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral tone, but suggests a slight positive view on learning useful languages)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (Presents a personal perspective but invites dialogue)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Expresses a mild emphasis on practicality; not overly strong)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Touches on the idea of practical use but lacks specific examples)

### Quarter 2:
**Text**: "In the case of a European, (I'm taking the Dutch as an example) Germany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Positive view regarding the utility of learning German)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Positioned as an assertion but grounded in economic context)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Strong emphasis on the economic rationale for learning German)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Provides concrete reasons for learning German based on trade)

### Quarter 3:
**Text**: "Germany is bordering to us, increasing the amount of times we meet, there is value in learning German for social reasons, like vacations or friendships, which isn't there for Asian languages..."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (Positive view toward social interactions facilitated by language learning)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Offers a strong argument regarding social utility)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (More intense call to the importance of social connections)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Specific examples of social value make it concrete)

### Quarter 4:
**Text**: "One of the best ways to learn a new language is immersion. It is easier to do so in Europe as a European. We have English, French and German as language options on TV for example..."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Positive outlook on immersion as an effective language learning method)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Confidently asserts the advantages of immersion in Europe)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on the benefits of immersion)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Very concrete with specific examples of available immersion methods)

These ratings reflect the overall tone, authority, strength, and clarity of the argument presented in each quarter.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To analyze the argument and provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break down the argument into its key components. Here's the assessment for each quarter of the text:

### Quarter 1:
**"Here is the small problem. it is far easier for a Chinese person to learn fluent English than a western to learn any level of fluent Chinese."**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The statement has a slightly negative tone, suggesting a problem exists in language learning.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument makes a comparative statement but does not assert overwhelming dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There’s a strong assertion about the difficulty levels in learning the languages.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The statement contains clear comparisons and specific subjects, making it relatively concrete.)

### Quarter 2:
**"When those two meet, guess what the language will be? English."**

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive inclination towards English as the outcome.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Makes a definitive claim about the outcome of a language meeting.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Certainly asserts a strong conclusion but in a less intense manner than the first quarter.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Relatively clear, but slightly vague about the specific context of "those two." It suggests an outcome without further elaboration.)

### Quarter 3:
**"I don't really advocate that it is better to learn Spanish than Mandarin, but I would say that there are a lot of people in China who know a little bit of Mandarin that are getting out compete by Chinese who speak English a lot better than westerns speak Mandarin."**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative, emphasizes competition but does not take a definitive stance on language preference.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Highlights the competition, suggesting those who speak English have an advantage, reinforcing dominance in the context of language skills.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There’s a stronger emphasis on competition and its implications for language learning.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete examples and specific situations addressed, particularly focusing on the competition between speakers.)

### Quarter 4:
**"for each quarter of the argument's text"**

- **Valence:** 0.0 (Lacks a clear argumentative stance or emotional tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.0 (No assertive claims or ideas presented.)
- **Intensity:** 0.0 (No intensity; it’s a neutral instruction/reference.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat concrete in referring to the structure of the argument but lacks specific context or content.)

### Summary Ratings:
1. **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
2. **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
3. **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6
4. **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.0, Dominance: 0.0, Intensity: 0.0, Concreteness: 0.5
