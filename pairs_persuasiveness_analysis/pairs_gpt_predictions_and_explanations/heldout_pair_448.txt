Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will analyze each of these aspects for each quarter of the text.

### 1st Quarter
**Text:** "And yet this thread is going to require semantics to argue against. So here we go. Of course there's always going to be one or two opinions out there that are ethically correct and thus there is no moral argument against them. I doubt there is a proof of nonexistence of an ethically correct opinion."

- **Valence:** 0.3 - The tone is somewhat negative, suggesting skepticism about the existence of universally accepted ethical opinions.
- **Dominance:** 0.4 - The speaker positions themselves as knowledgeable about the topic, but lacks assertiveness in tone.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The argument shows moderate intensity through assertions about ethical correctness.
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 - The language is somewhat abstract, lacking specific examples or clear definitions.

### 2nd Quarter
**Text:** "So the result is that the statement of this cmv is utterly useless. So the meaningful question isn't the one of existence. I think you actually state it as fact so I will say no more about existence."

- **Valence:** 0.2 - This section is quite negative, dismissing the cmv as "utterly useless."
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The speaker expresses strong disagreement, showing some authority in their position.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 - The intensity is high as the speaker emphasizes the futility of the discussion.
- **Concreteness:** 0.3 - This part remains vague in terms of providing specific evidence or examples.

### 3rd Quarter
**Text:** "The actual meaningful questions are which opinions are ethically correct, and how do I change an opinion? What if I think that exercising free will, failing to procreate, or just being gay is unethical? Well it's the job of the subreddit to change that. How?"

- **Valence:** 0.4 - The tone is more neutral here, posing questions that invite discussion rather than dismissing views outright.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The speaker takes a more assertive stance by framing the questions that they deem important.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - There is moderate intensity as the speaker seeks to engage rather than merely critique.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - The introduction of specific examples (free will, procreation, being gay) adds some concreteness to the argument.

### 4th Quarter
**Text:** "So there are only really two ways to attack someone's view: the best tool you have is going to be proof by contradiction, which is pretty semantic once you think about it. But most arguments of this type are going to be responded to with either calling it slippery slope or reduction ad absurdum (whatever the exact name was). These labels aren't always wrong and so these types of arguments aren't always easy to make. The easy way is to argue semantics..."

- **Valence:** 0.3 - The tone seems somewhat cynical, indicating frustration with the tendency to resort to semantics.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - The speaker strongly asserts their position on argumentation strategies, displaying confidence.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - There’s considerable intensity in discussing argument strategies and their effectiveness.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - This section is relatively concrete with references to specific argumentative techniques and labels.

### Summary of Ratings
1. **1st Quarter:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
2. **2nd Quarter:** Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.3
3. **3rd Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
4. **4th Quarter:** Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.6

These ratings reflect the fluctuating nature of the argument throughout its different sections, incorporating both strengths and weaknesses in the presentation of ideas.

Sure! Here's the rating for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for the four quarters of the provided argument.

### Quarter 1:
"Semantics are precisely about precise meaning, nuance and content. To dismiss an argument with 'it's just about semantics' is literally to say 'actual meaning of a statement doesn't matter to me.'"

- **Valence**: 0.8 - The tone is assertive and emphasizes the importance of meaning positively.
- **Dominance**: 0.7 - The speaker expresses control over the narrative by asserting the importance of semantics.
- **Intensity**: 0.6 - The argument is strong but measured; the use of "literally" adds emphasis.
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 - The language is clear and focused on a specific point regarding semantics.

### Quarter 2:
"Meaning is absolutely the single most important thing in any communication."

- **Valence**: 0.9 - This is a strong and positive assertion about the importance of meaning.
- **Dominance**: 0.8 - The statement conveys a strong position on the importance of meaning, asserting authority.
- **Intensity**: 0.7 - The use of "absolutely" adds a strong emphasis to the claim.
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 - The language is direct and leaves little room for misinterpretation.

### Quarter 3:
"But, if you are saying that nuances in meaning do not matter to a V in order to evaluate it properly, then I could not disagree more."

- **Valence**: 0.7 - This presents a counterargument that is somewhat confrontational yet measured.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 - There is a challenge established here, but it’s less dominant than previous sections.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - The phrase "I could not disagree more" expresses intensity but in a balanced manner.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - The idea of nuances and evaluation is clear, though slightly more abstract.

### Quarter 4:
"To dismiss an argument as to being just about semantics is to say that one can meaningfully argue against an imprecise and ambiguous statement."

- **Valence**: 0.5 - The tone is more neutral here, as it discusses implications without strong emotional weight.
- **Dominance**: 0.4 - This part seems more exploratory rather than asserting dominance in the conversation.
- **Intensity**: 0.6 - It retains some intensity by emphasizing the consequences of dismissing semantics.
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 - The language is fairly clear, but slightly more abstract due to the focus on implications.

These scores reflect the emotional and argumentative weight of each part of the text, based on the context you've provided.
