- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The language is straightforward without extreme emotional emphasis)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Uses specific historical references, which add grounding)

### Quarter 2:

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "That competition bids down the price that laborers can get in the western world including the USA. It has also resulted in the largest reduction in human poverty ever. So it's probably a good thing overall."

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "As workers in China get richer, they'll start to be less competitive with US workers, and it is likely US workers will be able to get higher wages. As to your specific student loan situation. That's the result of a poor decision on your part combined with a poorly structured government program. As time goes on, it is likely social norms about student debt will change, and this sort of thing become a bit less common, and also hopefully loan programs will be reformed."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed; some hope for future improvement but blames individual decisions)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Reasserts power dynamics but acknowledges potential changes)
