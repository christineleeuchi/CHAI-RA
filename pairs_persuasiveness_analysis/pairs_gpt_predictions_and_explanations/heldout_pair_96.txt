Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break it down into four quarters and provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each criterion:

**Quarter 1:** "There was a CMV a couple of days ago that boiled down to 'Why do atheist people believe it is ok to go up to those who want to promote their religion [and challenge their views with an atheistic viewpoint]?' and the answer to that question is literally 'Because I explicitly have the right to freedom of speech.'"

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it presents a question and a response without strong emotion)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The statement is more observational; it doesnâ€™t assert authority or control)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The language is straightforward and lacks strong emotive language)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The reference to a specific conversation gives it some grounding, but the abstraction of "freedom of speech" is somewhat general)

**Quarter 2:** "If they'd asked the question differently, then we could've talked about the merits of religion vs the merits of atheism, but as the question stood, freedom of speech is what gives an atheist the right to go and challenge a theist who is proselytizing in the public space."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Shows a slightly positive inclination towards open discussion)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Suggests that the speaker recognizes an opportunity for more meaningful dialogue)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Some engagement with the topic, but still measured)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Offers a clear context for discussion and the concept of proselytizing in public space)

**Quarter 3:** "I think that in most cases, you're right; if the *only* way you can defend what you say is 'it isn't illegal for me to say this' then you might want to rethink what you're saying..."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Balanced acknowledgment, no strong emotional pull)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts their opinion while respecting the other viewpoint)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Some assertiveness in suggesting rethinking one's argument, indicating stronger sentiment)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The hypothetical scenario presented has some practical grounding but remains abstract)

**Quarter 4:** "...but in certain scenarios it's the proper defense for the given attack (for lack of a better term)."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Slightly neutral, as it acknowledges the validity of the defense but hesitantly)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Suggests a limitation on the strength of the previous argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Offers a more accepting viewpoint but still displays hesitation)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Addresses the context of defense without specific examples)

### Summary Scores
- **Quarter 1:**
  - Valence: 0.5
  - Dominance: 0.4
  - Intensity: 0.3
  - Concreteness: 0.6

- **Quarter 2:**
  - Valence: 0.6
  - Dominance: 0.5
  - Intensity: 0.4
  - Concreteness: 0.7

- **Quarter 3:**
  - Valence: 0.5
  - Dominance: 0.5
  - Intensity: 0.6
  - Concreteness: 0.5

- **Quarter 4:**
  - Valence: 0.4
  - Dominance: 0.4
  - Intensity: 0.5
  - Concreteness: 0.5

These scores reflect a generally balanced argument that is somewhat neutral in tone but recognizes the importance of context and constructiveness of discussions around free speech and belief systems.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the provided argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, I will break it down into four quarters and assign scores accordingly.

**1. Quarter 1: "I think the 'free speech' argument would be appropriate in certain contexts,"**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; it expresses a moderate positive view on free speech)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker has an opinion but lacks assertiveness)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mild opinion; not strongly expressed)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Identifies free speech but remains vague about the contexts)

**2. Quarter 2: "such as when and where it would be appropriate to hand out literature in support of whatever your side of an argument is."**

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive; implies support for the idea of sharing literature)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker suggests an approach with some confidence)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; presents a clear example but not overly forceful)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Gives a specific action related to free speech, making it more tangible)

**3. Quarter 3: "The Church of Satan has called people's bluff on one or two occasions"**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to slightly negative tone regarding reactions to their actions)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The example shows a level of assertiveness in the argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; refers to specific actions taken)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete example that grounds the argument)

**4. Quarter 4: "by invoking 'open forum' rules to pass out literature in public schools, for instance."**

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive; supports the idea of free speech in public spaces)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker is assertive in citing a specific rule and its application)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately strong, emphasizes a legitimate practice of free speech)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Extremely concrete; provides a specific instance and context)

In summary, the scores for each quarter of the argument are as follows:

**Quarter 1:**  
- Valence: 0.5  
- Dominance: 0.4  
- Intensity: 0.4  
- Concreteness: 0.6  

**Quarter 2:**  
- Valence: 0.6  
- Dominance: 0.5  
- Intensity: 0.5  
- Concreteness: 0.7  

**Quarter 3:**  
- Valence: 0.4   
- Dominance: 0.6  
- Intensity: 0.5  
- Concreteness: 0.8  

**Quarter 4:**  
- Valence: 0.6  
- Dominance: 0.7  
- Intensity: 0.6  
- Concreteness: 0.9
