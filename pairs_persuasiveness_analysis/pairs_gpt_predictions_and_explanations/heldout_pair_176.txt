Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### 1st Quarter: "If someone uses the 'backdoor' to my bathroom lock, I both know about it when it happens, and have, presumably, consented to it, and it is being done for my best interests."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (The sentiment is generally positive regarding the 'backdoor' concept as a safety measure.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (This portion is more informative, establishing the idea of consent and awareness, which has a moderate level of dominance.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The intensity is moderate, as it presents a neutral state of affairs without strong emotional language.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The bathroom lock analogy is concrete and easy to visualize, making the argument more relatable.)

### 2nd Quarter: "Government surveillance is done in secret."
- **Valence**: 0.2 (The sentiment turns negative here, painting government surveillance in a bad light.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (This is a factual statement about government surveillance, retaining a moderate dominance level.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The phrase "done in secret" carries a greater weight and invokes concern, increasing intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (The idea of surveillance can be abstract; it lacks the concrete representation found in the previous quarter.)

### 3rd Quarter: "We can't review their behaviour to ensure it is in line with our values and interests."
- **Valence**: 0.3 (This continues the negative sentiment about government surveillance.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (This section asserts a sense of control that is lost, contributing to the dominance of the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There's a stronger emotional pull here, highlighting a key concern about oversight and accountability.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (While the concept is relevant, it remains somewhat abstract compared to more tangible ideas.)

### 4th Quarter: "Most importantly, it is not done in our best interests. A bathroom may be breached if the occupant is having a heart attack, but there is absolutely no danger to me from my own communications."
- **Valence**: 0.1 (This portion has a strong negative sentiment regarding government surveillance.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (It dominantly emphasizes the dangers and flaws in government surveillance, particularly contrasting with the specific bathroom analogy.)
- **Intensity**: 0.9 (It carries high emotional intensity, using a clear analogy to highlight a significant concern.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (While it refers back to a concrete analogy, the abstract nature of government interests versus personal safety makes it less concrete overall.)

### Summary Scores:
- **1st Quarter**: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.8
- **2nd Quarter**: Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.4
- **3rd Quarter**: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.5
- **4th Quarter**: Valence: 0.1, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.9, Concreteness: 0.6

Here's a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each dimension (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument's text:

### 1st Quarter
**Text:** "The arguments against surveillance are nearly always about indiscriminate, mass surveillance. Nobody really has a problem with targeted surveillance."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it points out a common argument but doesn't convey a strong positive or negative sentiment)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The use of "nobody really has a problem" implies a certain authority, but it's still a generalization)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The language is somewhat mild and doesn't evoke strong emotions)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The idea of "indiscriminate, mass surveillance" is concrete, but the term "targeted surveillance" is more abstract)

### 2nd Quarter
**Text:** "If the government has a warrant to search your house or listen to your phone calls, they can do so. But getting a warrant requires individualized probable cause to believe that you have committed a crime."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (More positive, as it supports a legal framework for privacy protection)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The statement conveys certainty and authority, emphasizing the legal aspect)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The language is clear but lacks strong emotional charge)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Very concrete due to legal terms and specific processes described)

### 3rd Quarter
**Text:** "In the analogy, using a pin to open the door is an action that is only taken in extremis to violate the privacy of the occupant for some more important purpose."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (A bit negative, as it speaks about violating privacy, but in a contextual sense)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate dominance since it presents a nuanced view of the analogy)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Decently intense, as it discusses violation of privacy and extremis situations)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The analogy is concrete, though somewhat metaphorical regarding the idea of "extremis")

### 4th Quarter
**Text:** "Likewise, the government should only use its surveillance powers to violate privacy when there is a strong reason to target the particular person(s) being surveilled."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive, as it promotes a conditional and careful use of surveillance powers)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The assertion conveys a sense of authority on the issue)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately intense, suggesting strong reasons for the use of surveillance)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat abstract, as it discusses the reasoning behind targeted surveillance rather than specific cases) 

These ratings reflect the overall sentiment, authority, emotional charge, and clarity of the argument presented in each quarter.
