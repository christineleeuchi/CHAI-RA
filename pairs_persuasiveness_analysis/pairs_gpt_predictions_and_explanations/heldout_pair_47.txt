Here's the rating for each aspect (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) of the presented argument based on each quarter of the text:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "So, I'm blatantly stealing a bunch of this from [this article](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/) so if you want to see it written much better than I can, read that.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To analyze the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it down into four distinct sections, scoring each section from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Section 1:  
**Text:** "In most of the world and especially during most of History, most people weren't rich, didn't have the resources to take care of a family in the long run, weren't seen as attractive, weren't educated or privileged and didn't have an appealing job."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (This section has a somewhat negative connotation, highlighting lack and scarcity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The statement is factual and assertive, but not overly forceful.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The emphasis on widespread historical lack creates a strong effect.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (It uses concrete details about historical conditions.)

### Section 2:  
**Text:** "Hell, until the 19th century the vast majority of the world's population worked in agriculture without any benefits from technology or hope for growth."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (This section is quite negative, focusing on hardships and lack of hope.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The use of the word "Hell" introduces a stronger element of authority in the statement.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The portrayal of agriculture conditions is strong and resonates with hardship.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Explicit historical reference adds to the concreteness.)

### Section 3:  
**Text:** "All of the things on your list are taken for granted today, but are completely unreachable for poorer and less privileged populations (= most people who have ever lived) throughout the world and History."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Somewhat neutral; recognizes the disparity but carries a sobering tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.55 (Assertive in calling out those disparities, but not overly aggressive.)
- **Intensity:** 0.65 (It carries a significant weight by emphasizing taken-for-granted aspects.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.85 (Connects current conditions to historical realities, grounding the argument.)

### Section 4:  
**Text:** "And yet people still fall in love and get married. So there must be something more to sex, love and marriage than what you used to think right? Otherwise underprivileged people getting married wouldn't make any sense."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (This section is much more positive, highlighting love and relationships.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Thereâ€™s a strong assertion in questioning the previous beliefs.)
- **Intensity:** 0.75 (The idea of love and marriage brings a hopeful intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (While love can be abstract, the context of marriage provides grounding.)

### Summary of Scores:
**Section 1: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.9**  
**Section 2: Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.9**  
**Section 3: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.55, Intensity: 0.65, Concreteness: 0.85**
