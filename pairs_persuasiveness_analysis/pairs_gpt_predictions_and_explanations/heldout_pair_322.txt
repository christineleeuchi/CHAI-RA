Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Sure! Here’s a rating for each of the four criteria for each quarter of the argument:

### **1st Quarter: "Life change substantially over the course of 18 years. Specifically the 18 years between when a person becomes a parent and when their child is old enough to go to college tend to be the formative years of their career. So while the average grad student cannot afford their child's college education *now* it doesn't mean that they will be unable to do so when the time comes."**

- **Valence:** 0.6 
  - The argument presents a somewhat positive view about the potential for change and improvement over time.
  
- **Dominance:** 0.5 
  - The tone is assertive, but it does not dominate the conversation; it counters a previous point rather than overpowering it.

- **Intensity:** 0.5
  - The intensity is moderate; it emphasizes a potential change without strong emotional language.

- **Concreteness:** 0.7
  - The argument is fairly concrete in terms of explaining the timeline of a child's life and how a parent's financial situation could change.

### **2nd Quarter: "You've *falsely* equated college to success or financial independence. At least speaking on behalf of the US, college is showing to be decreasingly useful in terms of providing a life of stability and financial prosperity."**

- **Valence:** 0.4 
  - This section has a more negative tone, challenging the validity of a prevalent belief about college education.

- **Dominance:** 0.6 
  - The argument is assertive in refuting a common idea, establishing authority on the topic.

- **Intensity:** 0.7 
  - The use of the word "*falsely*" injects a higher level of intensity and emotional engagement.

- **Concreteness:** 0.6 
  - The argument is relatively concrete, presenting a clear stance against the perceived value of college.

### **3rd Quarter: "Instead, the unfilled skilled labor jobs are now showing themselves to be the path to upward mobility. This includes plumbing, mechanics, heating/cooling, etc."**

- **Valence:** 0.7 
  - This section conveys a positive view of skilled labor occupations as viable paths to success.

- **Dominance:** 0.5 
  - It competes with previously established ideas but does not overwhelm them; it provides an alternative view.

- **Intensity:** 0.6 
  - The mention of specific jobs adds intensity, highlighting alternative pathways to success.

- **Concreteness:** 0.8 
  - This part is concrete in its suggestions, providing specific examples of skilled labor jobs.

### **4th Quarter: "Not to mention that even within the white-collar world, entrepreneurs and programmers *often* look down on college grads as being lazy, entitled and unambitious."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 
  - The tone here is quite negative, characterizing college graduates in an unfavorable light.

- **Dominance:** 0.7 
  - This assertion is strong and definitive; it challenges the perception of college graduates directly.

- **Intensity:** 0.8 
  - The language is quite intense, using emotionally charged terms like “lazy,” “entitled,” and “unambitious.”

- **Concreteness:** 0.5 
  - While the argument makes a clear point, it's more anecdotal and less supported by concrete evidence than previous quarters.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide the requested ratings (from 0.0 to 1.0) for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the argument, I will break down the assessment based on the provided text.

1. **Valence** (emotional tone)  
   - **Score: 0.3**  
   The argument carries a somewhat negative tone, particularly when discussing the expectations of parental support and the notion of laziness. While there are elements of personal achievement shared by the speaker, the overall tone leans toward criticism of those who might expect financial assistance for college.

2. **Dominance** (assertiveness and confidence)  
   - **Score: 0.8**  
   The speaker presents their views with significant confidence, stating opinions as facts and sharing personal experiences that back up their perspective. There is a clear sense of authority in their argument as they assert that college is becoming less important and that students should be responsible for their own education costs.

3. **Intensity** (forcefulness of emotion or expression)  
   - **Score: 0.7**  
   The intensity is moderately high, particularly in the latter half of the argument where the speaker uses phrases like “don’t be lazy” and “hustle, do whatever it takes.” This conveys a strong emotional charge about responsibility and personal effort, making the argument compelling and forceful.

4. **Concreteness** (clarity and specificity of ideas)  
   - **Score: 0.6**  
   The argument includes specific personal anecdotes and a clear stance on the expectations regarding college and financial responsibility. However, it lacks detailed exploration of the broader implications of the changing landscape of higher education, which could enhance the clarity and depth of the argument.

Overall Assessment:
- **Valence**: 0.3 (negative emotional tone)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (strong confidence in the argument)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (high emotional expression)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (clear ideas with some specifics)
