Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here is a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of each quarter of the argument provided:

**Quarter 1:**
"A lot of companies are not afraid of *frivolous* lawsuits. There have already been *successful* lawsuits (meaning the courts found merit in litigating them.) The basis of the label is therefore something that has already occurred and cost another company (or companies) significant amounts of money."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral; mentions costs and lawsuits, which could be perceived negatively or positively depending on the context.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker presents a viewpoint with authority based on facts about lawsuits.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The words “frivolous” and “successful” imply a moderate level of emotion; however, the overall tone is factual.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific reference to lawsuits and financial implications makes it relatively concrete.)

**Quarter 2:**
"A lot of companies know they're on the hook for 'foreseeable use.' Therefore they try to anticipate likely use of their products by people, regardless of the wisdom of that use. It's a lot easier and less costly to preempt dumb use than to make your case (at the expense of litigation) at court."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Slightly negative; implies that consumers can be "dumb" and highlights costs.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker projects confidence in companies' strategies.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (This segment carries a higher emotional charge regarding the need for companies to prepare for dumb usage.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The notion of “foreseeable use” and the business decisions made around it are relatively concrete but abstract in the context.)

**Quarter 3:**
"The cost of litigation has become so high that most companies end up settling out of court either with a regulatory agency's enforcement branch or a private litigant. There's also a public policy preference for settlement (or dispute resolution where applicable.) Thus there are fewer opportunities to even make your case, at least not cost effectively, and it's better to rigorously self-police."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral regarding costs; presents a real situation but hints at a lack of justice through litigation.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Assures that the speaker understands the legal landscape and how companies operate within it.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The mention of settling versus litigating elicits a sense of frustration but remains moderate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear descriptions of legal processes and outcomes add to the segment's concreteness.)

**Quarter 4:**
"Consumer product safety laws. The FDA, FTC, FCC, CPSC, and a number of other regulatory agencies require companies to put certain labels on their products, even 'obvious' ones. Some of these are obvious because the labels have become so ubiquitous that we now associate that characteristic *because* of the label. Minimization of harm. Usually one cannot sue until they've been harmed, or else there is nothing for the court to remedy. This is how we make people 'whole' via civil liability, and is the most common way we resolve these problems: self-regulation and internalization of costs by litigation. However, from a public policy perspective, we might not want people getting hurt at all. Consequently, we create those labeling laws as a matter of harm prevention, because we'd just rather people and products be safe - even obviously - than suffer the externalities of people getting hurt, public recalls, loss of brand integrity, and encumbering the judicial system."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Balances neutral perspectives on safety regulations and the acknowledgment of harm.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong authority established through detailed knowledge of laws and public policy.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Emotionally charged when discussing harm prevention, but still somewhat analytical.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Highly concrete due to specific agencies named and the consequences explained.)

Overall, the argument has a blend of factual elements and emotional undertones, reflecting both the challenges companies face and the implications of legal frameworks surrounding consumer safety.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings based on the specified criteria for each quarter of the argument:

   - Valence: 0.5 (Neutral, as it discusses a problematic behavior)
   - Dominance: 0.6 (Some dominance in the assertion about corporations protecting themselves)
   - Intensity: 0.5 (Moderate intensity with phrases like "dumb enough")
   - Concreteness: 0.7 (Concrete in expressing a clear situation of misuse)

2. **Quarter 2: "Corporations can't do much about people who misuse their products, but they can certainly protect themselves from liability when people misuse their products."**
