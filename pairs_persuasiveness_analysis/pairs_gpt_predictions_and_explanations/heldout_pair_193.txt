Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here's a rating for each of the requested dimensions of the argument:

1. **Valence**: 0.6 
   - The argument has a somewhat negative valence because it questions the consistency of feminism concerning equality but also acknowledges that it is focused on women's issues. 

2. **Dominance**: 0.7 
   - The speaker's tone suggests a moderate dominance as they are asserting their perspective on feminism and its priorities, indicating a clear stance on the issue.

3. **Intensity**: 0.5 
   - The intensity is moderate; while the argument expresses a critical view of feminism, it doesn't employ excessive emotional language or strong reactions, making it approachable and somewhat balanced.

4. **Concreteness**: 0.4 
   - The argument is somewhat abstract, discussing ideological frameworks and motivations without providing specific examples or data to ground the claims, leading to a lower score in concreteness.

These scores reflect the argument's overall characteristics based on the request.

Here's a rating score for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### First Quarter:
**Text:** "I think the problem you're having is that you are assuming that along with feminism making life equally good for women, feminism also seeks (or should seek) to make it equally shitty."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (The tone is somewhat critical but aims to highlight a misunderstanding rather than being outright negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts their perspective while challenging the opposing viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There's a moderate level of intensity as the speaker addresses a perceived misconception.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The argument is somewhat abstract, discussing assumptions rather than specific examples.)

### Second Quarter:
**Text:** "Imagine this scenario: You give two little kids ice cream cones. The first one drops theirs before getting to take a bite. To make it fair and equal, you decide to knock the second kid's cone to the ground. WTF? Why would you do that? Why would you choose to make the situation worse for either kid?"

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The rhetorical question adds a bit of frustration but maintains a playful tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker uses a strong example to illustrate their point.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The intensity is high due to the emotional impact of the situation and the use of "WTF?")
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This quarter provides a very concrete example to illustrate a complex idea.)

### Third Quarter:
**Text:** "Along that line of thinking, it makes zero sense to advocate for it being okay to hit women or for women needing to register for the draft or to try to revoke the idea that a woman being drunk does not allow for consent."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone continues to be critical, but it's more focused on logical reasoning.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker strongly critiques certain viewpoints often associated with feminist arguments.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The intensity is solid as it addresses potentially contentious issues directly.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It presents specific issues but remains somewhat abstract in terms of resolution.)

### Fourth Quarter:
**Text:** "The vast majority of feminists think the draft is wrong, that consent is mutual, and that it is wrong for anyone to hit anyone. But, being feminists, their focus is on women's issues and the issues you describe above are really men's issues - men should not be hit, men cannot consent while drunk, men should not have to register for the draft."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Tentative neutrality as it acknowledges feminist viewpoints while distinguishing issues.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a clear point about the distinction in focus between men's and women's issues.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Less intense than previous sections, focusing more on elaboration than emotional impact.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This section draws upon specific understandings of feminist beliefs, thus more concrete.)

### Summary:
1. **First Quarter:** Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.4
2. **Second Quarter:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.8
3. **Third Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6
4. **Fourth Quarter:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7
