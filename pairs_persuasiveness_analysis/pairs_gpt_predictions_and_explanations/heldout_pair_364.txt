Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here's the rating for each aspect of the argument in four quarters:

1. **First Quarter: "Umm.. How does white guilt explain why white people do it?"**
   - Valence: 0.2 (Neutral to slightly negative; it suggests confusion or frustration)
   - Dominance: 0.3 (Somewhat submissive; it expresses uncertainty)
   - Intensity: 0.4 (Moderately intense; there's a questioning tone)
   - Concreteness: 0.5 (Somewhat abstract; raises a question rather than stating a solid fact)

2. **Second Quarter: "Saggy pants aren't tolerable where I work regardless of race."**
   - Valence: 0.5 (Neutral; it's a clear statement of a personal opinion)
   - Dominance: 0.7 (More authoritative; asserting a rule or standard)
   - Intensity: 0.6 (Moderately intense; presents a definitive stance)
   - Concreteness: 0.8 (Concrete; specific context of a workplace is mentioned)

3. **Third Quarter: "Saggy pants are tolerated in public because you don't get to decide what everyone else wears."**
   - Valence: 0.6 (Slightly negative; implies frustration with societal norms)
   - Dominance: 0.6 (Balanced; acknowledges a common situation while asserting a viewpoint)
   - Intensity: 0.5 (Moderately intense; there's a clear assertion but not overly charged emotionally)
   - Concreteness: 0.7 (Concrete; refers to public norms and choices)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "Exposed boxer shorts is not obscene... Especially compared to a lot of other things people wear."**
   - Valence: 0.4 (Neutral to slightly positive; attempts to rationalize a viewpoint)
   - Dominance: 0.5 (Somewhat balanced; tries to justify a stance without being overly assertive)
   - Intensity: 0.6 (Moderately intense; argues against the severity of the issue)
   - Concreteness: 0.9 (Very concrete; directly addresses specific clothing and societal comparisons) 

These ratings reflect different dimensions of the argument presented and the emotions and authority conveyed in each part.

To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll assess each quarter of the text separately:

1. **Quarter 1: "Neither are miniskirts or shorts that ride up girls' asses. How could this be a result of white guilt?"**
   - **Valence:** 0.3 (The statement has a negative valence as it critiques certain styles of dress, but it does not express overt hostility.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.4 (There is a suggestion of superiority in the argument's framing, questioning the validity of emotions like 'white guilt,' but not in an overpowering way.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument presents a moderate intensity, expressing frustration or confusion about the societal implications of clothing styles.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The mention of specific clothing items gives some concreteness, but it still feels abstract in discussing broader societal issues.)

2. **Quarter 2: "By the way plenty of people call this out, publicly. Many businesses and public buildings have signs that don't allow it."**
   - **Valence:** 0.6 (This part asserts a more positive stance by referencing public action against certain styles, which can be viewed as a proactive approach.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (It conveys some authority by highlighting that there are organizations enforcing dress codes, suggesting a collective societal expectation.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (The intensity is higher as it emphasizes a social consensus and active response to dress codes.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This section is concrete, citing specific actions taken by businesses and public spaces regarding clothing.)

3. **Quarter 3: "So are you arguing that just saggy pants specifically should be a civil/criminal offense?"**
   - **Valence:** 0.5 (This is a neutral tone questioning the specific focus on saggy pants, though it carries a hint of skepticism.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.4 (It challenges the opponent's argument without asserting dominance but instead seeks clarification, staying conversational.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (The intensity is moderate, as it raises a critical question but lacks strong emotional weight.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The phrasing is direct and concrete, explicitly asking about the implications of the specific dress code.)

Overall, based on these assessments, the ratings for each quarter are as follows:

1. Quarter 1: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
2. Quarter 2: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.7
3. Quarter 3: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.5
