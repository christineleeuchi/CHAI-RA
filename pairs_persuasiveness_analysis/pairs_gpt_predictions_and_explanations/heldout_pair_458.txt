Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text, here are the scores:

**Quarter 1: "Trying a child as an adult actually gives them more rights than they would otherwise get."**
- Valence: 0.6 (Neutral-positive; suggests a benefit to trying children as adults)
- Dominance: 0.5 (Moderate assertion that can be countered)
- Intensity: 0.5 (Mildly intense; asserts rights but lacks strong emotional charge)

- Intensity: 0.6 (Moderate intensity; conveys importance of these rights)
