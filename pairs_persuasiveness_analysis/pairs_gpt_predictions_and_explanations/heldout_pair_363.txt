Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Let's break down the provided argument into four quarters and rate each quarter for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

**Quarter 1: "This is an impossibility. Those labels are self-imposed."**  
- **Valence:** 0.7 (The statement has a somewhat negative tone, suggesting opposition to the idea. However, it's not completely dismissive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a strong opinion, which shows dominance in the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; while the use of "impossibility" carries weight, the expression is not overly passionate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The idea of labels being self-imposed is somewhat abstract without specific examples.)

**Quarter 2: "Most people - namely those fighting for a cause - won't elect pejorative labels for themselves."**  
- **Valence:** 0.8 (This quarter has a positive tone toward those fighting for a cause, acknowledging their intent regarding labels.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The statement reflects a general observation rather than asserting dominance; it’s more of an insight than a challenge.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The intensity is low to moderate; the point is valid but is presented without strong emotion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This statement is more concrete, discussing people's choices regarding self-identification.)

**Quarter 3: "You want to distinguish those who want equality (feminists) by calling them egalitarian."**  
- **Valence:** 0.6 (This portion has a neutral to slightly negative tone depending on interpretation; it implies a judgment of the suggested terminology change.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker attempts to engage with and challenge the idea without being overly assertive.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The intensity is relatively low; the argument is analytical rather than emotional.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (This statement is somewhat concrete as it directly addresses the suggestion made in the initial argument.)

**Quarter 4: "Probably not. Those who are perceived to be Femenazis, probably perceive themselves as Feminists."**  
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone suggests skepticism, but it's not entirely negative, leaving room for understanding.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker shares a perspective, leading the argument without definitively dominating the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The intensity is moderate; the use of "probably" softens the assertion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The statement is more concrete as it discusses perceptions of identity, but it still relies on speculation.)

**Summary of Scores:**
1. Quarter 1: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.4
2. Quarter 2: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.6
3. Quarter 3: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.3, Concreteness 0.5
4. Quarter 4: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.5

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here’s a rating based on the four criteria for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1: "I think we just need to make the feminist organizations that are more egalitarian prominent."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Generally positive view towards promoting egalitarian organizations)

- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat vague, as it doesn't specify which organizations)

### Quarter 2: "I personally have been doing research and haven't really found any, which doesn't mean they don't exist, but they should be brought out and heard."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive intent to bring attention to overlooked groups)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Suggestive rather than commanding)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (A moderate interest in the topic, balanced with uncertainty)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Mentions personal research, but lacks specific examples or names)

### Quarter 3: "Media puts too much focus on the extremists in feminism, and that gives everyone a negative view of the word."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Critique of media emphasis, but it can seem negative)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Establishes a clear view but does not forcefully push it)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Conveys a strong sense of concern about media portrayal)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (More concrete with a specific source of the problem identified)

### Quarter 4: "I wish we heard more from feminist egalitarian organizations, or leaders too..."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive desire for balance and more focus on egalitarian perspectives)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Expresses a wish rather than a command)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong desire for change and clarification in the movement)
