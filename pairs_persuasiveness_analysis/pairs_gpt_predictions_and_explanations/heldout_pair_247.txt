Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument based on the criteria you provided, I will break it down into quarters and evaluate each aspect accordingly.

1. **First Quarter: "If you want cold and forests, I'd suggest Canada instead."**
   - Valence: 0.7 (The suggestion is positive as it offers an alternative that aligns with the original desire for cold and forests.)
   - Dominance: 0.5 (It presents a suggestion but does not necessarily assert dominance over the initial idea of moving to Scandinavia.)
   - Intensity: 0.6 (The statement has a moderate level of intensity as it conveys a strong suggestion.)
   - Concreteness: 0.8 (The argument is clear and specific about what the person desires—cold and forests.)

2. **Second Quarter: "Since it's clear you speak English, it also has the advantage of not having to learn a new language..."**
   - Valence: 0.8 (This portion is very positive, accentuating an advantage of Canada—language familiarity.)
   - Dominance: 0.6 (It offers a compelling point that can overshadow potential challenges associated with language.)
   - Intensity: 0.5 (This section presents a solid point but is less intense.)
   - Concreteness: 0.9 (The argument is concrete as it directly addresses a practical concern around language barriers.)

3. **Third Quarter: "...it's probably substantially easier to move there..."**
   - Valence: 0.8 (Highlights an easy pathway, evoking positive feelings about the relocation process.)
   - Dominance: 0.7 (This section asserts the ease of moving to Canada as an advantage over Scandinavia.)
   - Intensity: 0.7 (There is a strong impression of Canada as a feasible option.)
   - Concreteness: 0.9 (The argument provides specific details about the TN visa and advantages, making it concrete.)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "If you want a more 'foreign' experience..."**
   - Valence: 0.6 (Suggests an alternative option but isn’t as strong as previous sections.)
   - Dominance: 0.5 (This section offers a workaround rather than a decisive argument.)
   - Intensity: 0.4 (The intensity drops here as it serves more as an additional note.)
   - Concreteness: 0.7 (While still concrete, it offers an additional suggestion and may not be as clear-cut as the prior sections.)

**Summary Ratings:**
- **First Quarter:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Second Quarter:** Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.9
- **Third Quarter:** Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.9
- **Fourth Quarter:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.7

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Sure! Here’s a rating score for each of the categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1:
**Text**: "I'm Danish. My workplace has roughly 60% foreigners from all over the world, except Africa and the middle east - not because they won't hire them, but because we get 0 applications, probably because it's a tech company and people from there don't have the qualifications."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; presents a factual statement with a mild undertone regarding the lack of applications)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker's perspective is definitive, but it’s primarily descriptive)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Low intensity; mostly observational, no strong emotions expressed)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Concrete details are given about the workplace and the demographics)

### Quarter 2:
**Text**: "So, I know second hand from them what it's like coming here from different places in the world. Basically, the more Danish you look and act, the easier a time you will have."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (Slightly positive; implies that fitting in can lead to better experiences)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (A strong claim about social dynamics that reflects personal observations)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate intensity; tone suggests concern but not extreme)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Somewhat abstract; relies on personal experience but lacks specific examples)

### Quarter 3:
**Text**: "You will face stigmatization if you are from Eastern Europe... the same probably goes, albeit to a lesser degree, if you look like you are from the middle east."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (Negative; explicitly addresses stigmatization and fear)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Strongly asserts negative social perceptions)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (High intensity due to the emotional weight of stigma)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Moderate; discusses abstract social perceptions without specific examples)

### Quarter 4:
**Text**: "You will pay a high tax... All schooling is free, even University... All medicare is free, except dentists."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Mixed to positive; highlights benefits like free education and healthcare)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Descriptive but provides a clearer view of societal benefits)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate intensity; informative but not overly emotional)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Very concrete; provides specific figures and benefits)

These ratings reflect a subjective analysis of the argument and may vary based on individual perspectives.
