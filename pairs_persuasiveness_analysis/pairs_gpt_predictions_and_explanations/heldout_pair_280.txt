Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "I think it's also worth acknowledging that the context and audience of your criticism. If you're talking to a bunch of white people, it's worth recognizing that you all have hard to overcome biases and misconceptions about what it's like to be a minority. If you're talking to a group of black people as a white person, it's worth keeping in mind that your ethos may not be very strong."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, acknowledging biases without outright negativity)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Acknowledges a position of potential inferiority in the context of discussion)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Relatively mild in tone, focusing on acknowledgment rather than strong emotion)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Discusses specific contexts but remains slightly abstract in terms of the implications of those contexts)

---

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "So it may be incorrect to say as an absolute that white people can't criticize minorities, but I'd also say that it's very difficult to effectively and empathetically do so."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Somewhat positive in recognizing the possibility of criticism while being cautious)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Maintains an equal ground in conversation, balancing both sides)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate intensity, as it's a measured approach)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (States a clear opinion while remaining somewhat abstract about the nuances)

---

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "You might also want to consider that making moral judgments of *people* is a lot more complicated and problematic than making moral judgments of *actions*. Is interrupting rude? Of course it is. But have you never done something rude? How do we begin to qualify your relative shittiness to the BLM girl's shittiness, based on the severity and amount of rude things you two have done in your lives, in order to give you the moral high ground to criticize her character?"

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Some negativity in questioning moral superiority but reasonable in context)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Weak dominance as it poses questions and suggests humility)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity due to the strong wording and emotional undertones)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Very concrete in its examples and logical reasoning)

---

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "It's way easier to say 'it's rude to interrupt,' and be done with it. Leave out the personal condemnations."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive suggestion for simpler, more productive engagement)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Holds a moderate position, suggesting a helpful approach without asserting authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity suggesting a shift in action and focus)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Generates a clear, actionable suggestion but remains somewhat abstract about how to execute it)

### Summary:
Overall, the argument evolves from a neutral stance to a more critical and intensely pointed critique of bias, thereby increasing in dominance and valence throughout.
