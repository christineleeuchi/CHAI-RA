Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the four dimensions (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument. 

**1st Quarter: "I grew up without tv, so from my perspective, everyone else seems to be slow-boiled into accepting ads. I loath them, and if there isn't a good reason to have ads on a service then I don't see a good reason to pay for it or them. I see this as voting with my dollar."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (The argument expresses a negative feeling towards ads, reflecting dissatisfaction.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker positions themselves as a discerning consumer, asserting their opinion against ads, but does not completely dominate the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The speaker's strong dislike for ads suggests a moderate to high intensity of feeling.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The mention of "voting with my dollar" gives a clear action but is somewhat abstract regarding how they relate to the situation.)

**2nd Quarter: "If you remember, Hulu originally said they would offer paid tiers that would allow for more expensive shows to be ad-free with the higher cost subscriptions (I liked this idea). When they axed this plan I bowed out."**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The sentiment is more neutral than negative here, expressing disappointment rather than outright anger.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (While sharing an opinion, the speaker is providing a reaction to Hulu's decisions, which gives them a less dominant role compared to Hulu.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a sense of personal disappointment, showing moderate intensity in the feelings expressed.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The mention of specific past plans by Hulu provides a clearer basis for the opinion.)

**3rd Quarter: "Fulfilling a person's desires in a marketplace is how innovation happens and at the moment Hulu is not innovating in my direction—so they don't get my money."**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (This section has a more neutral tone, focusing on innovation rather than negativity toward Hulu.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts their opinion strongly and clearly in terms of marketplace principles.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument maintains a moderate level of intensity, as the speaker is expressing a principled stance.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The connection between market desires and innovation makes this point specific and actionable.)

**4th Quarter: "Other companies *are* innovating in my direction. I'm also spoiled about having a machine to wash my clothes and ride a car instead of a horse."**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Still a neutral tone; there is satisfaction in finding alternatives but also some critique.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The mention of other companies shows a comparative stance, but it doesn't shift the overall dominance in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The intensity is lower here, as the comparison is somewhat lighthearted rather than charged.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (References to modern conveniences provide relatable examples, but they are metaphorical.)

These scores reflect the different components of the argument and how they convey the speaker's feelings and perspectives.
