Sure! Here's the rating for each of the specified categories—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—broken down by each quarter of the argument.

To evaluate the argument provided, I'll break it down into four quarters and give ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness based on the content and context:

### Quarter 1: "I am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax."

- **Dominance (0.3):** The speaker is primarily sharing an observation or experience rather than asserting dominance in the conversation.
- **Intensity (0.4):** The language is mild and descriptive, with no strong emotional appeal or forcefulness.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** The statement is specific and provides clear context about inheritance tax in Spain.

### Quarter 2: "Yeah I can see how that would be a problem. Particularly for people who do not want to sell their loved ones home, but who also don't have the liquid assets available to pay the tax."
- **Valence (0.7):** There is a slight increase in positive sentiment toward empathizing with those affected by the tax situation.
- **Dominance (0.4):** The speaker acknowledges the problem, but does not take an authoritative stance; rather, they show understanding.

### Quarter 4: "Essentially, at least in the case of the US, the estate tax only affects people who are quite wealthy, or those who are moderately wealthy but only have one or two living relatives."

- **Dominance (0.6):** The speaker presents a perspective that could influence the audience’s views on the fairness of the tax, asserting a clearer position.
