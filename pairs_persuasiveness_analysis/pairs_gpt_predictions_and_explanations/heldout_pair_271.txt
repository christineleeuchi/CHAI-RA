Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s how I would rate the different aspects of the provided argument, broken down into four quarters of the text:

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.8 (The tone is mostly supportive and understanding, though it does not fully avoid the uncertainty of emotions)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker expresses a friendly suggestion while not being overly authoritative)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The suggestions are made gently, not in an urgent or forceful manner)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The advice to talk to someone trained and seek help is specific, but somewhat general in execution)

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.9 (This part is empathetic and recognizes the situation without judgment)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker continues to maintain a non-dominating voice, supportive and gentle)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is an emotional weight to the acknowledgment of coping strategies, but still not overwhelming)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Referring specifically to coping strategies provides clearer imagery)

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (This section acknowledges differing perspectives on coping, suggesting empathy towards both sides)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (There’s a slight shift towards an authoritative perspective, but it remains conversational)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The mention of varying coping methods carries importance but is balanced)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The focus on the results of actions is somewhat abstract, but the conversation about hitting is more tangible)

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The mood turns slightly more introspective with the question but remains positive)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (This part is very open-ended, encouraging a response without dominance)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The question invites reflection rather than conveys strong emotion)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The query is quite general, which keeps it from being very concrete)

Overall, the argument portrays a good balance of support and understanding, with varying shades across the four quarters.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Sure! Here’s a breakdown of the given argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, rated from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the text:

**Quarter 1:**
"Child abuse fucks people up, badly. I believe the best way to avoid this is to allow a child to hit his parents back, strictly in self defense alone."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Strong negative sentiment regarding child abuse, positive sentiment toward the idea of self-defense)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker's opinion is authoritative, but there’s still room for debate)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The phrasing is emotionally charged, especially with the use of "fucks people up")
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Concrete idea presented, but it lacks empirical support at this point)

**Quarter 2:**
"I grew up in a similar situation to the one you described, with an alcoholic, physically and verbally abusive father between the ages of 10 and 18."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Negative sentiment due to the abusive situation described)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The personal experience adds credibility, but it’s more anecdotal)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The language is straightforward, yet the context holds emotional weight)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear description of the situation creates a vivid picture)

**Quarter 3:**
"That said, there are two things in particular I took from that experience which I believe are contrary to 'this should be customary';"

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral sentiment, as it begins to analyze rather than express emotion)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced tone, setting up a logical argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Less emotional; presenting reasoned points)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument is being framed, but specific examples are not yet provided)

**Quarter 4:**
"While I agree that defending oneself from a physical aggressor... fighting your parents shouldn't be seen as a customary way of avoiding future emotional/psychological distress from said abuse."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative, addressing a contentious issue)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker is asserting their viewpoint strongly based on personal experience)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Balanced but still carries emotional resonance from the personal story)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Strong argument presented with clear and relatable conclusions)

Overall, the argument presents a nuanced view on the topic of self-defense in abusive situations, supported by personal experience.
