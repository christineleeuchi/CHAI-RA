Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the scores based on the dimensions you provided for each quarter of the argument:

### 1st Quarter
**Argument**: If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness?

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral, as it presents a concern for welfare but invokes a difficult choice)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The argument asserts that prostitution is a necessary evil for survival)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderately impactful as it raises serious concerns but without passionate language)
- **Concreteness**: 0.3 (Abstract concepts of starvation and homelessness without specific examples)

### 2nd Quarter
**Argument**: While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

- **Valence**: 0.6 (More positive than negative as it leans toward justifying prostitution as a lesser evil)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (It suggests a balancing act between harms, maintaining a certain level of authority)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Slightly stronger emotional pull due to the imagery of suffering, but could be more dramatic)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Concepts are present but remain somewhat vague, lacking detailed scenarios)

### 3rd Quarter
**Argument**: It's a false equivalency to say that people have a choice between either A) prostitution or B) starvation. In most western countries, prostitution is practically never the *only* option women with limited marketable skills/education have to make money, it just happens to be the most lucrative.

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Negative valence as it directly challenges the previous argument's moral stance)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (Stronger assertion with a clear refutation of the original claim)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity since it clearly contests the argument but is still presented in a reasoned manner)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Better grounding in reality as it outlines alternatives but lacks specific examples)

### 4th Quarter
**Argument**: While it's true that low wage work isn't great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises. There are virtually zero of these in prostitution.

- **Valence**: 0.8 (Negative, asserting that prostitution has fewer opportunities than traditional work)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strongly authoritative as it presents a well-defined contrast between low wage work and prostitution)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (High intensity due to implicit criticisms of the prostitution model and concern for long-term effects)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Heightened concreteness through logical comparisons and projections about career prospects)

### Summary of Scores
- 1st Quarter: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.3
- 2nd Quarter: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.4
- 3rd Quarter: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.8, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
- 4th Quarter: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument provided, I will rate each quarter based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, using a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Quarter 1: 
**Argument:** Your argument assumes that a person may be faced with a choice between sex work and slow starvation. This isn't true in most first world nations. The social safety net does a pretty good job keeping mouths fed. 

- **Valence:** 0.8 (The tone is somewhat positive in challenging the assumption, but it highlights a serious social issue.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument asserts confidence in the effectiveness of social safety nets, positioning the speaker as knowledgeable.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There's a moderate level of intensity in challenging the original assumption, but it's not overly forceful.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The reference to the social safety net provides a concrete basis for the argument.)

### Quarter 2:
**Argument:** There are exceptions to this of course, but most of them are solvable (husband drinks all the money away) or involve other illegal activity (drug addictions).

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, though it mentions solvable issues, it acknowledges the complexity of some situations.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less dominant, as it presents exceptions without firmly stating a position.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, but not strongly persuasive.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat concrete, but relies on examples that may not provide a solid basis.)

### Quarter 3:
**Argument:** So, given that the social safety nets will keep people from starving, what's the difference between legal sex work and illegal sex work? If sex work is legalized, poor people will have to try sex work before welfare becomes available to them. 

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Balanced, but introduces a negative implication about welfare access which invokes concern.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Assertive in highlighting the potential consequences of legalization.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (A more intense point, as it raises a worrying scenario.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument is relatively concrete but could benefit from more empirical support.)

### Quarter 4:
**Argument:** "Can't get a normal job? Have you tried prostitution? No? Well, try that, and *then* the government will help you out." 

- **Valence:** 0.7 (More negative due to the highlighting of an uncomfortable scenario for many.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong in terms of asserting a perspective on government expectations.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Quite intense, as it uses rhetorical questions to provoke thought.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat abstract, as it presents a hypothetical without concrete data.)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.7
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.8, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.5
