Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument provided, I will assess valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text.

1. **First Quarter: "The example is a straw man."**
   - **Valence: 0.5** (Neutral; points out a logical flaw without strong emotion)
   - **Dominance: 0.4** (Moderately dominant as it asserts the argument is flawed)
   - **Intensity: 0.3** (Low intensity; more of a statement than an emotional appeal)
   - **Concreteness: 0.6** (Somewhat concrete; references a specific logical fallacy)

2. **Second Quarter: "\"It's free speech\" is almost never used as a persuasive argument."**
   - **Valence: 0.4** (Slightly negative; suggests a limitation of the phrase)
   - **Dominance: 0.5** (Moderate dominance as it makes a declarative statement)
   - **Intensity: 0.4** (Moderate intensity; implies a critique of a common phrase)
   - **Concreteness: 0.5** (Moderately concrete; discusses a common argument type)

3. **Third Quarter: "Especially without that context the word 'wrong' is quite ambiguous."**
   - **Valence: 0.3** (Neutral to slightly negative; points out vagueness)
   - **Dominance: 0.4** (Moderately dominant; emphasizes the importance of context)
   - **Intensity: 0.4** (Moderate intensity; raises a point of clarity)
   - **Concreteness: 0.5** (Moderately concrete; discusses ambiguity but lacks specific examples)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "If someone espouses a controversial morally motivated position in public - let's say there's a bunch of antiwar protesters holding a licensed parade. Now someone with pro-war views might say the protesters are wrong to protest, but the protesters would be right to defend the protest as free speech during the license review."**
   - **Valence: 0.5** (Neutral; presents a balanced view of conflicting opinions)
   - **Dominance: 0.5** (Moderate dominance as it elaborates on a situation and context)
   - **Intensity: 0.6** (Moderately high intensity; describes a real-world scenario)
   - **Concreteness: 0.8** (High concreteness; provides a specific example illustrating the point)

**Summary:**
1st Quarter: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6  
2nd Quarter: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.5  
3rd Quarter: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.5  
4th Quarter: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8  

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To assess the argument you provided based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break it into quarters and evaluate each aspect accordingly.

### Quarter 1: "I feel like there's a categorical error here."
- **Valence (0.7):** The statement conveys a positive assertion, suggesting that there's an error to be corrected, so it has a slightly positive valence.
- **Dominance (0.6):** The use of "I feel" indicates a personal perspective, which displays some assertiveness but is not overly commanding.
- **Intensity (0.5):** The tone is moderate; it expresses disagreement but does not use strong language or emotional appeals.
- **Concreteness (0.6):** The term "categorical error" implies a specific type of logical mistake, but it does not provide concrete examples at this point.

### Quarter 2: "Arguing the logic of a position is not the same thing as arguing for the right to voice an opinion."
- **Valence (0.8):** This statement is clear and affirmatively correct, endorsing the importance of distinguishing between two concepts.
- **Dominance (0.7):** The phrasing indicates a stronger position than the previous quarter, asserting a critical understanding of the discussion.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The language is firm, indicating a strong belief in the necessity of acknowledging the difference, yet it remains measured.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** This sentence effectively communicates a distinct idea, making the abstract concepts more relatable and clear.

### Quarter 3: "You're allowed to say, 'the sky is red,' even if you're wrong."
- **Valence (0.9):** This illustrates the freedom of expression positively and embraces the idea of free speech without judgment.
- **Dominance (0.8):** It confidently asserts a truth about free speech, conveying authority on the subject matter.
- **Intensity (0.7):** This part has a higher emotional appeal, as it expresses the right to speak freely, despite inaccuracies.
- **Concreteness (0.9):** The example provided is very concrete and relatable, making the argument easily understandable.

### Quarter 4: "I don't know that '...but, free speech!' is used to defend positions so much as a defense against censorship or calls to censorship."
- **Valence (0.7):** This statement carries a neutral to slightly positive tone, emphasizing the context of free speech.
- **Dominance (0.6):** It presents a moderate stance, suggesting contemplation rather than an outright assertion of dominance in the argument.
- **Intensity (0.5):** The tone is relatively even-keeled, lacking in emotionally charged language.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** The argument increasingly clarifies the context in which free speech is relevant, tying it effectively to censorship.

In summary, here are the scores:

- Quarter 1: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6
- Quarter 2: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.7
- Quarter 3: Valence 0.9, Dominance 0.8, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.9
- Quarter 4: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.7
