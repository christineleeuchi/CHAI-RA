To evaluate the argument, I will provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text. Valence refers to the emotional value (positive or negative), dominance refers to authority or control in the argument, intensity refers to the strength or passion behind the argument, and concreteness refers to how specific and tangible the ideas presented are.

**Quarter 1: "If we consider pure pragmatics and the wellbeing of the child, this is not effective. The desired behaviour is the child receiving proper nutrition and nutrition related modelling behaviour. The biggest barrier is parent behaviour and poverty: working poverty, fiscal poverty, generational poverty, knowledge, and habit."**
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is mildly negative regarding the effectiveness of the approach but focuses on child wellbeing)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument suggests an understanding of complexities, positioned with authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Some passion behind implications about child nutrition, but not overly strong)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (References specific barriers, but somewhat abstract in discussing the broader societal issues)

**Quarter 2: "Criminalizing a behaviour is not as strong a deterrent as many people think (consider marijuana, piracy, and jaywalking). Charging the parents will not change their behaviours or make them more able to care for their children properly."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative perspective on criminalization, suggesting ineffectiveness; conveys frustration)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly asserts an opinion about the failure of deterrent effects, showing authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate to high intensity about the ineffectiveness of punitive measures)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Uses examples to clarify points, but remains somewhat abstract around parenting behaviors)

**Quarter 3: "Charging parent for a younger child's weight also promotes child abuse via crash diets and laxatives, and rewards parents whose children may be malnourished but thin. Charging a parent for a school aged or older child brings into question the responsibility of the school as a nutritional provider and the child themselves."**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Strongly negative about the potential consequences of charging parents, highlighting risks)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate authority; discusses the implications raised without asserting a conclusive stance)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Higher intensity, especially in the critique of the system that could promote child abuse)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete examples of potential outcomes and scenarios make it vivid)

**Quarter 4: "Finally, I assume the outcome of an unpaid charge is jail or apprehension. Removal of a child from parental care is extremely damaging and expensive, and can lead to generational repercussions. It is only 'worth it' if the alternative is severe abuse or neglect."**
- **Valence:** 0.1 (Very negative regarding potential outcomes suggesting significant harm to children)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Reflective authority discussing systemic impacts; indicates ownership of knowledge)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity, underlining the severity of consequences regarding child welfare)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Conveys specific outcomes (jail, child removal) but relies on hypothetical situations)

Overall, the argument presents a nuanced critique of potential responses to childhood obesity, emphasizing the substantial complexities involved and the risks associated with punitive measures against parents.
