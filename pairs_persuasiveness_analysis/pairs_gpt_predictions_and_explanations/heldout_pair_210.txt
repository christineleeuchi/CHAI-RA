Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument based on the specified dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I'll provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the argument's text.

### 1st Quarter:
*Valence: 0.6* - The argument presents a somewhat positive perspective on eating meat when reforming practices, but it still acknowledges a moral concern regarding animal suffering.

*Dominance: 0.5* - The argument is moderately dominant as it asserts a position (that reformed meat-eating can be acceptable) but is still somewhat tentative and open to challenge.

*Intensity: 0.5* - The intensity is moderate as the speaker argues their point clearly but does not use strong emotional language.

*Concreteness: 0.7* - There is a specific claim regarding industrial farming and the potential for reformed practices, providing a clear basis for discussion.

### 2nd Quarter:
*Valence: 0.5* - The argument maintains a neutral tone while discussing animal rights and harm, simply presenting them as facts without strong positive or negative connotations.

*Dominance: 0.6* - Here, the argument has a stronger claim about animal rights and non-consensual sex being harm, which lends it a more assertive tone.

*Intensity: 0.7* - The term "harm" and comparisons to torture and rape invoke a stronger emotional response than previous sections.

*Concreteness: 0.6* - While the definitions and concepts presented are clear, they are somewhat abstract, which affects their concreteness.

### 3rd Quarter:
*Valence: 0.5* - This section discusses the tension between ideas, maintaining a neutral view of the complexities around killing versus harming.

*Dominance: 0.5* - The argument presents a questioning stance, not claiming dominance over the discussion but rather exploring potential resolutions for conflicting ideas.

*Intensity: 0.6* - The exploration of tension introduces a more serious tone, and the acknowledgment of differing views adds a level of depth.

*Concreteness: 0.4* - This part is more abstract, as it delves into philosophical reasoning about harm, which may be less tangible for some readers.

### 4th Quarter:
*Valence: 0.6* - This section shows a more positive view of the conceptualization of death, depending on how it is framed (e.g., as a harm only for those who care).

*Dominance: 0.5* - It maintains a balanced view, allowing for multiple interpretations without asserting one definitive standpoint.

*Intensity: 0.6* - The discussion about the nature of harm and death introduces a more contemplative intensity, though it still lacks emotional urgency.

*Concreteness: 0.5* - While the argument is interesting and thought-provoking, it remains somewhat abstract, focusing on philosophical positions rather than concrete examples.

### Summary Scores:
1st Quarter: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.7  
2nd Quarter: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6  
3rd Quarter: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.4  
4th Quarter: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5

Here’s a rating for each of the four criteria — valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness — for each quarter of the argument text provided:

**1st Quarter: "Under the moral framework of rational self-interest, objectivism, virtue-value ethics, or Aristotelian ethics eating meat of animals is good because it gives us sustenance..."**
- **Valence: 0.7** (The statement has a positive valence as it supports the act of eating meat.)
- **Dominance: 0.6** (The argument asserts a moral right that positions human interests over animal interests.)
- **Intensity: 0.5** (It's moderately intense as it claims sustenance as a justification but does not evoke strong feelings.)
- **Concreteness: 0.6** (There’s a concrete reference to sustenance, but the overarching frameworks are more abstract.)

**2nd Quarter: "...and the *means* are justified as we have rights over beings that don't have the potential for free will or rational thought."**
- **Valence: 0.6** (Slightly positive valence as it justifies the act of eating meat but underscores a negative view of animals.)
- **Dominance: 0.7** (It emphasizes human rights and dominance over animals, solidifying a power dynamic.)
- **Intensity: 0.4** (The intensity is lower as it presents a philosophical assertion rather than a strong emotional appeal.)
- **Concreteness: 0.5** (This quarter is somewhat abstract but touches on rights which gives it some grounding.)

**3rd Quarter: "Beastiality (as with rape or sex with a tree) is bad because it is an act that is self destructive i.e. self demeaning to the perpetrator..."**
- **Valence: 0.8** (The statement clearly presents a negative valence, condemning bestiality.)
- **Dominance: 0.5** (While it asserts that bestiality is bad, it does not assert dominance in terms of moral hierarchy as strongly as previous sections.)
- **Intensity: 0.7** (Higher intensity due to the strong language around self-destructive and demeaning behavior.)
- **Concreteness: 0.5** (While it discusses self-demeaning, it's still somewhat abstract regarding the nature of these acts.)

**4th Quarter: "Under this system, it's moral or immoral depending on the effect on the actor/eater/fornicator - rather than the effect on the actee/eaten/fornicated."**
- **Valence: 0.5** (Neutral to slightly positive valence as it discusses morality without strong emotional charge.)
- **Dominance: 0.4** (Less dominant as it looks at the perspective of the actor rather than asserting broader moral conclusions.)
- **Intensity: 0.6** (The idea of moralism is more complex, giving it a moderate level of intensity.)
- **Concreteness: 0.7** (It provides a clearer framework for understanding morality related to the effect on the agent, making it more concrete.)

In summary, the ratings across the four quarters reflect how the arguments resonate in terms of their ethical justification, emotional weight, and clarity.
