Here are the requested ratings for the argument provided, based on the qualities of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

1) **Valence: 0.4**
   - The argument presents a largely negative view of Napoleon's heirs and critiques his decisions regarding Russia, which tends to lower the overall positive sentiment associated with the topic of Napoleon. However, it doesn't outright reject the quality of his leadership or reforms, maintaining a somewhat balanced tone.

2) **Dominance: 0.5**
   - The argument expresses a moderate level of authority by challenging the previous interpretation of Napoleon's Russian campaign.

3) **Intensity: 0.6**
   - The remark regarding his heirs and their lack of genius adds a strong emotional element, as it positions Napoleon's legacy in a somewhat critical light, enhancing the intensity of sentiment. Additionally, emphasizing tactical blunders in Russia and potential British resistance lends weight to the critique, contributing to a more passionate tone.

4) **Concreteness: 0.7**
   - The argument includes specific historical references, such as the Zulu and the burning of Moscow, thus adding clarity and grounding to the points made.
