Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here’s a rating score for each aspect of the argument broken into quarters:

### 1st Quarter: 
**Argument:** "Things which you must not pierce (soup dumplings) are much more difficult to eat with a fork, especially if you want to eat it in more than one bite."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (This statement is positively framed—arguing in favor of chopsticks for a specific scenario.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (It presents a strong case for chopsticks due to the delicate nature of soup dumplings.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The contrast between chopsticks and forks creates a moderately intense preference.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (The argument is concrete, referencing a specific food item and its eating technique.)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Argument:** "Chopsticks are easier to carry around."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (This is a neutral statement, generally positive but lacking strong emotional appeal.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It provides a valid point, but it doesn't dominate the discussion about efficiency or effectiveness in eating.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate and not very compelling.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This is a straightforward and clear point, though slightly abstract.)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Argument:** "Chopsticks are good for eating popcorn without dirtying your hands. Chopsticks can be dual wielded (quad wielded?) for extra efficacy when eating."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The positive aspect of not dirtying hands appeals to cleanliness, which many would appreciate.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The concept of dual wielding is interesting but may not be compelling or dominant.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a moderate intensity in advocating for their versatility, though it's a minor issue.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Both arguments are quite concrete and relate to specific situations.)

### 4th Quarter:
**Argument:** "Chopsticks are excellent light-duty tongs for cooking... Makeshift chopsticks work. I just picked up my computer mouse using two pens as chopsticks. It's just a matter of mastery."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positively framed, highlighting the versatility of chopsticks in everyday scenarios.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The point about dual-use and adaptability strongly supports chopsticks' superiority over forks in some situations.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The mastery aspect adds an encouraging intensity to the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (The points are clear, specific, and relatable, especially the makeshift use case.)

These scores reflect the effectiveness of each quarter of the argument in persuading others to consider using chopsticks over traditional cutlery.

Here’s a rating score for each of the four aspects—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—across the argument divided into quarters:

### Quarter 1: "As a Japanese, some subtle things come to mind:"
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; it’s neither positive nor negative, just a statement of identity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.3 (The phrase suggests some authority due to identity, but not overwhelmingly strong.)
- **Intensity**: 0.2 (Low intensity; there’s no strong emotion expressed.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Somewhat concrete due to the mention of identity but lacks specific examples.)

### Quarter 2: "* Rice: I can use chopsticks to pick up individual grains of rice that might be left at the end, which would be difficult to do with a fork."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (Positive; highlights a specific benefit of chopsticks.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Moderate dominance; presents a clear advantage.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity; the ease of using chopsticks evokes a sense of satisfaction.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Very concrete; provides a specific scenario using chopsticks.)

### Quarter 3: "* Noodles: Slippery noodles like udon or soba are much easier to hold on to with wooden chopsticks than wrapping them around a fork."

- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Very concrete; directly applies to a common experience.)

### Quarter 4: "* Fish: I can't imagine trying to separate the meat of a grilled fish from its bones with a fork and a knife. Chopsticks give me the flexibility to more precisely control the direction and the amount of pressure that I can apply on the fish to cleanly extract out bones."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (Very positive; shows a clear superiority of chopsticks in a complex task.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strong dominance; presents chopsticks as the better choice in a specific situation.)
