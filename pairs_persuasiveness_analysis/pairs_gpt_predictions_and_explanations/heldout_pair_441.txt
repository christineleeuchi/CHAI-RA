Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Sure! I'll evaluate the argument in four quarters. For each quarter, I'll provide a score for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, using a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Quarter 1:
**Text**: "One major point that I think you need to consider is personal preference. Like it or not, most people prefer the freedom to leave when exactly when they want, directly from their current location, and directly to their destination. These are things that public transportation requires compromises on, often quite significant compromises in the type of environment that most Americans live in."

- **Valence**: 0.8 (Generally positive, emphasizes personal preference and freedom)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strongly asserts individual preference over public transportation)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderately intense in highlighting the importance of personal choice)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Some abstract concepts about personal preference and compromises, but also some concrete ideas about freedom)

### Quarter 2:
**Text**: "With that in mind, even if you were somehow able to fund and construct the *perfect* public transportation system, I don't think you'd get anywhere near 100% adoption by the public. I live in a fairly public transportation 'friendly' city, by most standards, and while our system is far from perfect, it is fairly extensive. I find it personally more pleasant to take the bus when going downtown, rather than dealing with traffic."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral tone, acknowledges limitations of public transportation)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Highlights personal experience and anecdotal evidence)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Calmly asserts skepticism about complete adoption but does show personal preference)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Concrete personal experience and specific scenario mentioned)

### Quarter 3:
**Text**: "By the way, while we have a relatively good public transit system, we have a really poor infrastructure for driving. Everyone here complains about the traffic, and it's only continuing to get worse. I only point this out to say that my city is probably close to a best case scenario for giving people incentive to use public transit."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (Mixed feelings; recognizes some benefits but also expresses frustration with driving conditions)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Claims the position that driving infrastructure could deter public transport usage)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity with assertions about traffic and transit linkage)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Use of tangible examples related to the cityâ€™s infrastructure and public perceptions)

### Quarter 4:
**Text**: "If a relatively good public transit system loses out in peoples minds to a relatively poor private vehicle system, then I don't think our time is best spent making a good public transit system marginally better. There's a parallel argument that might make this point better. A lot of people choose to drive large trucks or SUVs either because they use the hauling capacity for work or leisure, or honestly, sometimes just because they want to..."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative about the effectiveness of improving public transport)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Establishes an argument against focusing solely on public transportation)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Clear passion about practicality in choices people make, acknowledging reality)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Draws parallels with real-world examples of vehicle choices, concrete and relatable)

Overall, this argument presents a nuanced perspective that recognizes the importance of personal choice and preferences, while also addressing practical challenges and real-world scenarios related to public transportation and individual vehicle use.
