To evaluate the argument using the specified categories, I will break down the text into four quarters and provide scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter.

### Quarter 1: 
"The main reason is that it creates an understanding/mentality that the Civil War *actually* wasn't *really* about slavery," when in fact slavery was basically the root of all dissent between the North and South."

- **Valence:** 0.9 - The statement carries a strong negative connotation towards the misunderstanding of the Civil War's motives.
- **Dominance:** 0.8 - The argument demonstrates a clear authority on the subject by asserting that slavery is central to understanding the Civil War.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 - The argument is assertive and somewhat passionate, emphasizing the importance of recognizing slavery's role.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The reference to "understanding/mentality" is abstract, though it clearly indicates a specific perspective.

### Quarter 2: 
"There's an old adage that in elementary/middle school you learn that the Civil War was about slavery, in high school you learn that it wasn't just slavery, but also X Y and Z so therefore it wasn't *really* about slavery, but then in college/university you learn that yes X Y and Z (industry v. agriculture, western expansion, relations with foreign powers, especially the UK and France, etc.) were issues, but that they could all be traced back to the divisive issue of slavery..."

- **Valence:** 0.85 - The tone remains critical but also informative, aiming at a deeper understanding of historical education.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The argument presents a progression of learning that demonstrates authority, yet it's more descriptive than assertive.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The passage is measured and less emotive, focusing on educational progression.
- **Concreteness:** 0.75 - This part references specific historical themes, making it more concrete.

### Quarter 3: 
"...it's fair to say that the institution of slavery was the divisive factor in the Civil War, and the main reason that the **slave states** seceded from the Union. It's also worth noting that you can say the Civil War was primarily caused by the question of slavery, while still noting that not all Southerners were slave-owning bigots..."

- **Valence:** 0.8 - The implication here is strong but acknowledges nuance, creating a balanced view of Southern identity.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - The argument maintains authority while advocating for a multifaceted understanding of the Civil War.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - The tone is moderately forceful, though it begins to incorporate complexity which softens the intensity.
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 - There’s a clear distinction made between different groups of people, providing a more tangible understanding.

### Quarter 4: 
"...their 'way of life' rested upon their need to enslave other human beings to maintain it, and is a common staple of Confederate apologia. There's also the issue of the Fugitive Slave Law, a federal law pushed for by Southern congressmen which required Northerners and Northern states to hand over slaves that escaped to the North..."

- **Valence:** 0.9 - This part has a strong negative connotation regarding Confederate apologia and the justification of slavery.
- **Dominance:** 0.9 - The argument asserts clear authority, especially when connecting historical law to societal behavior and contradiction in states' rights rhetoric.
- **Intensity:** 0.8 - The language is passionate and critical, particularly when discussing slavery and its implications.
- **Concreteness:** 0.85 - This section references specific laws and actions, making the points quite tangible and real.

### Summary Scores:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence 0.9 | Dominance 0.8 | Intensity 0.7 | Concreteness 0.6
- **Quarter 2:** Valence 0.85 | Dominance 0.6 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.75
- **Quarter 3:** Valence 0.8 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.6 | Concreteness 0.8
- **Quarter 4:** Valence 0.9 | Dominance 0.9 | Intensity 0.8 | Concreteness 0.85

This analysis shows that while the argument is strong overall, it varies in its clarity and emotional impact across different segments.
