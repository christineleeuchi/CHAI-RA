To assess the argument provided, we'll break it down into quarters and give ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1: "I think it helps to distinguish patriotism from nationalism."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral tone - presenting a distinction without a strong positive or negative charge)
- **Dominance**: 0.3 (The speaker expresses a personal opinion, which has less authoritative dominance)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The statement is opinion-based; therefore, it's not highly intense)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (The idea of distinguishing terms is somewhat concrete but lacks specific examples)

### Quarter 2: "Patriotism could be defined as allegiance to the best hopes and ideals of your country."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (Positive connotation, as it associates patriotism with ideals)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The definition implies a level of authority, but itâ€™s still a personal interpretation)
