- **Valence (0.7)**: The sentiment conveys a neutral-to-positive approach by suggesting careful selection, which implies a level of thoughtfulness.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The statement is assertive, indicating a level of control in choosing conversation partners, but not overly dominant as it's a recommendation rather than a command.

### Quarter 1: "Just find the right people to discuss these things with. I know exactly who I can talk to about political issues and who not to. It's not worth it for me to bring up what I think about Reaganomics to everyone I'm friends with because I know that may not go over well in the long run."

### Quarter 4: "I would also suggest, don't start talking about your radical stance on the eugenics of the human species by immediately aborting genetically deficient babies with people that you only just recently met (assuming abortion is your topic of choice when discussing politics) because I'm sure the general population doesn't sit well with that idea and/or have never even entertained that idea before."
