Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating for each aspect of the argument:

1. **Valence: 0.8** - The argument conveys a strong positive valence as it promotes inclusivity and challenges the concept of ethnic purity. It advocates for the rights of individuals to choose where they live without restrictions based on ethnicity.

2. **Dominance: 0.6** - The argument displays moderate dominance. It asserts the speaker's perspective on immigration and ethnic identity, challenging opposing views with logical reasoning. However, it does not completely overpower counterarguments; it engages in a discussion rather than presenting an authoritarian stance.

3. **Intensity: 0.7** - The intensity of the argument is high but not at its peak. The use of strong language (e.g., "backwards concept," "myth used to propagate hate") conveys a passionate viewpoint, although it remains somewhat controlled and reasoned.

4. **Concreteness: 0.5** - The argument has a moderate level of concreteness. While it discusses abstract concepts like ethnicity and nationality, it could benefit from concrete examples or data to strengthen the case. References to specific nations help ground the argument but do not provide detailed evidence. 

Overall, the argument is articulate and persuasive, though it leaves room for further development through clearer examples or data.
