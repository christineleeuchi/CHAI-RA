Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To analyze the argument you provided, I will provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument's text.

**1. First Quarter: "I intend to change your view, but I'm out for a few minutes to get coffee and breakfast."**

- **Valence: 0.5** - This statement is neutral; while it indicates a willingness to engage in a discussion, it doesn't evoke strong positive or negative emotions.
- **Dominance: 0.3** - The speaker is in a position of intent to persuade, but is temporarily unavailable, which diminishes their dominant position.
- **Intensity: 0.4** - The intent to change someone's view is somewhat intense, but the mention of being out for coffee reduces this intensity.
- **Concreteness: 0.6** - The mention of concrete actions (getting coffee and breakfast) adds a level of clarity, but the overall intent is still quite abstract.

**2. Second Quarter: "I'll start with a couple quick points."**

- **Valence: 0.6** - There's a positive tone here, as the speaker is indicating readiness to engage in the discussion.
- **Dominance: 0.6** - The speaker asserts some control by indicating they will lead the discussion with points.
- **Intensity: 0.5** - The phrase expresses a moderate level of intensity since they are preparing to present arguments.
- **Concreteness: 0.5** - The statement is somewhat abstract, as it does not specify what the points will be.

**3. Third Quarter: "Do you feel it's appropriate to label Facebook as a vanity site?"**

- **Valence: 0.4** - This question could have a slightly negative connotation towards Facebook but is mostly neutral, as it’s probing rather than making a judgment.
- **Dominance: 0.5** - The question asserts some control over the dialogue, engaging the other person to think critically.
- **Intensity: 0.5** - It has a moderate intensity as it challenges the listener's perspective but is not overly confrontational.
- **Concreteness: 0.7** - This statement is concrete, as it directly addresses a specific platform and issue.

**4. Fourth Quarter: "How would you feel about Frankie making the same comments about something Suzie did while walking through the mall with her friends or family?"**

- **Valence: 0.5** - This question is neutral and invites the listener to think about a scenario without strongly evoking either positive or negative feelings.
- **Dominance: 0.4** - The speaker is less dominant here as they are asking a question rather than making an assertion.
- **Intensity: 0.5** - The intensity remains moderate; it prompts thought but isn’t highly charged.
- **Concreteness: 0.6** - This statement is somewhat concrete as it presents a specific scenario, although it still involves hypothetical reasoning.
