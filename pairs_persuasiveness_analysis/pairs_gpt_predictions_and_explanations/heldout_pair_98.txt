Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To assess the argument's counter-point regarding the acceptability of professions that might not yield personal satisfaction, here are the ratings for each aspect:

### Valence (positive-negative feeling):
**Score: 0.4**  
The argument has a negative valence, discussing unpleasant and unsatisfying jobs, such as soldiers and executioners. However, it attempts to find some positive value (e.g., defense of the homeland, enforcing justice), but these positives are overshadowed by the overall negativity associated with the professions mentioned.

### Dominance (degree of control or power expressed):
**Score: 0.5**  
The argument acknowledges the power and control inherent in certain professions (e.g., soldiers and executioners as agents of society). However, it also highlights the lack of personal satisfaction, implying that while these roles have significant societal weight, the individuals within them may not experience fulfillment, leading to a more balanced score.

### Intensity (strength or forcefulness of expression):
**Score: 0.6**  
The argument conveys a strong message about the nature of certain professions, particularly the weight of their moral and emotional implications. The examples provided (soldiers and executioners) evoke strong feelings and provoke thought, contributing to the intensity.

### Concreteness (specificity and clarity of ideas):
**Score: 0.7**  
The argument uses specific examples (soldiers, executioners) to illustrate its points, making it quite concrete. The reference to soldiers' sentiments and the mention of justice enforcement create clear imagery and context for discussing the lack of satisfaction in these roles.

Overall, the argument effectively challenges the initial claim with strong examples and emotional depth, but it also recognizes the complexity of the issue at hand.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Sure! I'll assess the argument provided in quarters based on the requested dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1:
"I think feelings of satisfaction and wellbeing are internal states not directly caused by our job performance."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The statement is neutral, suggesting a thoughtful perspective without strong emotional resonance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker presents a personal belief, but doesn't assert authority over the subject, allowing for alternative views.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The tone is moderate, lacking impassioned language or strong emphasis.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The statement references internal states, which are somewhat abstract, but the concept of satisfaction is concrete enough to grasp.)

### Quarter 2:
"While I agree people should feel satisfied, I don't think the job is the problem. Satisfaction is an internal state."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (There is a slightly positive tone in advocating for satisfaction while clarifying the source.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker expresses a well-formed opinion, contributing to a balanced discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The agreement and assertion create a balanced, moderately strong statement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Restates the concept of satisfaction, but emphasizes the internal aspect which still has a degree of abstraction.)

### Quarter 3:
"I have some friends who have felt deeply unsatisfied in professions like teaching, social work, and nursing."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This quarter has a more negative tone, highlighting dissatisfaction.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker introduces anecdotal evidence, stimulating relatability without dominating.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The use of "deeply unsatisfied" conveys a strong emotional impact.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Mentions specific professions, making the argument more tangible and relatable.)

### Quarter 4:
"And yet I know others who find deep satisfaction in oil and gas, fast food, and big box retail. Those who feel unsatisfied should explore the roots of their dissatisfaction before moving on."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive note in recognizing satisfaction in various jobs, balanced by a call to self-reflection.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced view comprising different perspectives while guiding toward introspection.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The encouragement for exploration of dissatisfaction is intense and thought-provoking.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Specific job examples make the conclusions more concrete and actionable.)
