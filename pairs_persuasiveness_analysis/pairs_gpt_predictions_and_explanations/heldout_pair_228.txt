Here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1
**Valence**: 0.6 (The argument presents a somewhat negative view of countries using WMDs against their own citizens, while providing a more neutral perspective on US actions with a historical context.)  
**Dominance**: 0.4 (It suggests that the US's actions set a precedent, but focuses on comparing with others rather than asserting a clear hierarchy.)  
**Intensity**: 0.5 (The language is moderate; it raises significant points without extreme language.)  
**Concreteness**: 0.5 (References to specific countries and actions provide some level of concreteness, but the points are somewhat abstract.)

### Quarter 2
**Valence**: 0.5 (This section is neutral to slightly positive towards the US's handling of nuclear weapons, framing it within a historical context.)  
**Dominance**: 0.6 (The assertion that the US has the legitimacy to secure nuclear weapons implies a favorable view of US dominance.)  
**Intensity**: 0.4 (The tone remains moderate and factual.)  
**Concreteness**: 0.6 (The mention of historical actions and specific military practices gives it more validity.)

### Quarter 3
**Valence**: 0.6 (The argument posits that semi-failed states are more dangerous, which inherently carries a negative implication about those states.)  
**Dominance**: 0.5 (Suggests that the US is safe due to its structure, but the comparison remains somewhat balanced.)  
**Intensity**: 0.5 (The points raised are significant, but they are laid out in a balanced way without hyperbole.)  
**Concreteness**: 0.5 (Cites countries that might be problematic but does not provide in-depth analysis or examples.)

### Quarter 4
**Valence**: 0.7 (This section leans more negative regarding the potential dangers of other states possessing nuclear weapons, which is more alarming.)  
**Dominance**: 0.6 (It frames Israel's nuclear capabilities as potentially more volatile, indicating a shift in perceived dominance among nations.)  
**Intensity**: 0.8 (Thereâ€™s a heightened sense of urgency and concern about the implications, making it a more intense argument.)  
**Concreteness**: 0.5 (While it references Israel specifically, the points are still somewhat general without detailed evidence.)

Overall, the argument fluctuates in its approach, ranging from neutral assessments of the US to more intense concerns about other nations.

Here is a rating score for each aspect of the argument presented:

1. **Valence** (0.5): The argument presents a mixed valence. It recognizes the grave consequences of using atomic bombs, suggesting a moral dilemma, but it also defends the use of atomic weapons in terms of preventing larger loss of life. The overall tone lacks strong positive or negative emotionality, rendering a neutral score.

2. **Dominance** (0.6): The argument asserts a certain level of dominance by emphasizing the USA's unique role in atomic weapon use and war initiation. It challenges the reader to reconsider their viewpoint and positions significant evidence behind its claims. However, it does not aggressively undermine opposing views, settling at a moderate score.

3. **Intensity** (0.7): The argument demonstrates a high intensity, particularly in discussing the implications of atomic weapon use and the catastrophic outcomes of war. Phrases like "full-scale world war" and "existential conflict" convey a strong sense of urgency and seriousness regarding the topic.

4. **Concreteness** (0.8): The argument provides concrete data and historical context, such as casualty estimates from the bombings and the potential loss of life from a land invasion of Japan. These specifics lend a high level of clarity and support to the claims made throughout the argument.

Overall, these ratings reflect the argument's complexity and the interplay of nuanced points regarding the implications of nuclear weapon use and military engagement.
