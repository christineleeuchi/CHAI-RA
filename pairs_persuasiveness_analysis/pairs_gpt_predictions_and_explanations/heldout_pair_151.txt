Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here’s an evaluation of the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, scored from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the text:

### First Quarter
**Text:** "I mean, I know a lot of Vietnamese-Americans who were refugees from South Vietnam who probably would have preferred the other side winning. So I don't think you're alone, but I think perhaps you're assuming that had the American backed South won, these problems would be fixed."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The statement acknowledges different perspectives and suggests possibility, but is somewhat skeptical.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker presents a counterargument but doesn't necessarily assert dominance over the opposing viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The tone is moderate, neither overly emotional nor completely detached.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument uses some concrete examples but remains somewhat abstract in generalization.)

### Second Quarter
**Text:** "I know you said the North was corrupt, but the South was every bit as corrupt. They probably wouldn't have been able to support the economy any better, and depressions and famine may have ensued anyway, albeit they may get support from the US."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The assertion about corruption in both regions leans toward a negative view of both sides.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (This section challenges the assumption that South Vietnam would have been better, showing a stronger stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument presents historical assessment and opinions, thus moderately intense.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Referencing economic conditions adds some tangible elements to the argument.)

### Third Quarter
**Text:** "Remember that a significant number of Vietcong in the South were southerners who were disillusioned with the corruption of the government. So they in effect fueled quite a lot of backlash against themselves. I'd also point out that the government was rather unstable, as seen in the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (This section emphasizes disillusionment with government, leaning more negatively.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The reference to instability presents a stronger case, though it does not completely dominate the discourse.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The discussion of internal strife and government instability is more intense and emotional.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Specific references to the Vietcong and historical events provide concrete support.)

### Fourth Quarter
**Text:** "If there was that much turnover, there could potentially be wars in the future over other rival factions or even communist resurgence or a probable and continual insurgency. So there's a significant potential that more Vietnamese would die in the coming years than the already horrible toll paid. Also, if the DRVN won the war, I highly doubt they'd be able to solve the border dispute between Vietnam and China considering those countries have been at odds for centuries if I'm not mistaken. My point here is that unfortunately the choice between a good government and a bad government appears to have been an illusion, and while unfortunately the current government isn't good, I guess you might say it's 'the devil you know', considering things could have gone worse."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (While highlighting potential negative outcomes, it recognizes the current situation's stability.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The tone is cautionary rather than assertive, lacking strong dominance over the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The potential for conflict and suffering is described with considerable intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Speculative scenarios are rooted in historical context, though they remain hypothetical.)

Overall, these ratings reflect a balanced consideration of the complexities behind the argument, illustrating varying perspectives on Vietnam’s historical context.

Here is the rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each aspect of the argument across the three points presented:

### Argument 1:
- **Valence**: 0.6  
  The argument has a generally negative tone regarding South Vietnam’s government and its legitimacy, highlighting corruption and undemocratic practices. However, it does acknowledge some historical context, which adds a nuanced perspective.
  
- **Dominance**: 0.8  
  The argument presents a strong stance, focusing on the failures of South Vietnam’s governance and making a compelling case about the instability caused by this governance, which the author believes contributed to eventual outcomes.
  
- **Intensity**: 0.7  
  The emotional resonance is significant, especially in discussing self-immolation and political oppression. The language used reflects the pain of historical injustices, giving the argument a heightened emotional intensity.

- **Concreteness**: 0.7  
  The argument provides concrete examples, such as the self-immolation of Buddhist monks and the political instability post-Diem. These illustrative points make the abstract concepts more tangible.


### Argument 2:
- **Valence**: 0.5  
  This argument has a critical tone towards U.S. motives during the Cold War but does not lean entirely negative or positive. It illustrates instances of U.S. intervention globally, which presents a broader picture of foreign policy motives.

- **Dominance**: 0.7  
  This argument presents a strong critical voice regarding U.S. actions and intentions. The author adeptly connects Vietnam's situation to larger geopolitical themes, asserting dominance in the discussion of the Cold War's impact on Vietnam.

- **Intensity**: 0.6  
  The argument conveys urgency regarding the nature of U.S. intervention and its consequences but lacks emotional intensity compared to the first argument, as it is more analytical.

- **Concreteness**: 0.6  
  The examples given (Chile, Guatemala, South Korea) are specific and lend credence to the argument, though they are not as directly related to Vietnam compared to the first argument’s specifics.


### Argument 3:
- **Valence**: 0.4  
  This argument attempts to advocate for a diplomatic approach and acknowledges the complexities of the current geopolitical situation, resulting in a more neutral or slightly negative tone toward aggressive attitudes.

- **Dominance**: 0.5  
  The argument seeks to temper aggressive rhetoric through diplomacy but does not assert dominance. It presents a counter-argument to the idea of confrontation with China without taking a particularly strong stand.

- **Intensity**: 0.5  
  The emotional intensity seems moderate; while it hints at frustration with nationalistic sentiments, the argument focuses more on rational discourse regarding diplomacy.

- **Concreteness**: 0.5  
  Some appeal to concrete examples (ASEAN collaboration), but the argument is more abstract in discussing diplomacy without strong, specific historical analogies.

### Summary Scores:
- **Argument 1**: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.7  
- **Argument 2**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.6  
- **Argument 3**: Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.5
