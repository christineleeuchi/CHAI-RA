To rate the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter, let's break it down:

### 1st Quarter:
- **Valence (0.4)**: The tone is primarily negative, expressing frustration over unfairness, but it does acknowledge a reality of life, resulting in a moderate negative score.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The speaker presents a strong perspective, emphasizing their frustration but not asserting absolute authority or superiority.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The emotion is palpable, particularly in the expression of frustrations and unfairness, showing a high level of concern.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The argument makes some intangible claims about feelings and fairness but lacks specific examples or data.

### 2nd Quarter:
- **Valence (0.3)**: Continues to express negativity around the unfairness of the situation for men, resulting in a slightly lower score as it becomes more repetitious and critical.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: Maintains a personal authority over the narrative, but does not escalate to confrontational language.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The frustrations peak here, especially with the rhetorical repetition of "it's not fair,” increasing the intensity.
- **Concreteness (0.4)**: Though the emotional appeal is strong, there are still few grounded examples; the argument is largely abstract criticism of the situation.

### 3rd Quarter:
- **Valence (0.3)**: The negativity continues, analyzing the familial consequences of the lack of male responsibility, which again emphasizes unfairness.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The speaker maintains a strong personal stance and continues to assert their views without being overbearing.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The emotional weight here is significant as it addresses real-life consequences for children, enhancing the intensity.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The argument touches on specific consequences but still lacks deeper substantiation or examples to solidify its claims.

### 4th Quarter:
- **Valence (0.4)**: This section recognizes the harsh truths of adulthood, which brings slight moderation to the overall tone of negativity.
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The affirmation of adulthood and personal responsibility offers a stronger, more assertive stance.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: There’s an acceptance of reality, but not an overwhelming emotional charge compared to earlier sections.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: It offers a clearer perspective on what responsibility means for men, providing a more direct message.
