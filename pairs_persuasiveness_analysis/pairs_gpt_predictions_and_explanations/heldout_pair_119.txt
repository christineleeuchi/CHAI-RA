Sure! Hereâ€™s a rating for each dimension you requested (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1: "While white people will never be able to understand what it means to be a minority"
- **Valence:** 0.2 (The statement has a negative connotation, suggesting an inability to empathize.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (It asserts a perspective but does not impose authority or control over others.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The wording is strong and definitive, conveying a clear stance.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The statement is abstract, referring to understanding rather than concrete experiences.)

### Quarter 2: "I have to protest that first off."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; it's an expression of dissent but doesn't carry strong emotional content.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (It indicates a challenge to the previous assertion without dominating the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Mild intensity; it expresses disagreement but does so in a measured way.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat concrete as it states a clear response but does not delve into specifics.)

### Quarter 3: "Why would a white person be unable to understand what it means to be a minority? White people have been a minority in the global sense for years."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (It has a somewhat positive connotation as it opens a dialogue for understanding.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It critiques the initial assertion with a counterpoint, adding to the conversational weight.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The use of rhetorical questioning creates a strong emphasis on the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It offers specific reasoning by referencing global demographics, making it more tangible.)

### Quarter 4: "There are also many white people who live in majority non-white places."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (This is positive as it recognizes diversity of experiences and supports the argument.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It reinforces the argument's validity, asserting a greater point and broadening the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; it's factual and assertive but does not evoke strong emotional response.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This is very concrete, providing a specific example to back up the argument.)

Overall, the argument evolves from a negative portrayal of the initial claim to a more positive and assertive challenge, ultimately providing concrete examples to support its perspective.
