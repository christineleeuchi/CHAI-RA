Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here's the rating for each of the parameters you requested for the provided argument:

1. **Valence (0.6)**: The argument has a mostly positive tone, as it supports a broader perspective on strategy in the context of competition, but it also acknowledges the limitations of the initial argument. The phrase "I agree that this is usually the best strategy" indicates some level of agreement but also suggests a nuanced view, impacting its valence slightly negatively.

2. **Dominance (0.4)**: The argument is more exploratory and less assertive than a dominant stance would be. It presents alternative strategies and emphasizes the importance of context, which suggests it is not aimed at dominating the conversation but rather adding to it. The acknowledgment of other strategies reduces its dominance.

3. **Intensity (0.5)**: The intensity is moderate as the argument presents a logical counterpoint to the original claim. While it does highlight critical nuances, it lacks strong emotional language or urgency, resulting in a balanced intensity score.

4. **Concreteness (0.7)**: The argument provides specific examples and practical considerations about sabotages that could occur in the context of competition, which enhances its concreteness. The references to scenarios, like forgetting eggs, make the argument tangible and grounded in reality. 

Overall, the argument effectively engages with the original assertion while providing additional perspectives and examples.
