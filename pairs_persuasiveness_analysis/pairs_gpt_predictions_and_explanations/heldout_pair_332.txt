Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings for the argument you provided, based on the specified criteria:

1. **Valence**: 0.5  
The argument presents a mix of both positive and negative feelings, aiming to shed light on the importance of recognizing male victims of rape while also acknowledging the societal issues surrounding both genders. However, it largely reflects a somewhat negative and critical perspective on societal views, which balances out the overall valence.

2. **Dominance**: 0.6  
The argument carries a strong tone, asserting that societal expectations place undue shame on male victims and that there is a clear need for a shift in perspective regarding male rape. It positions itself as more assertive and critical regarding societal norms, which gives it a higher dominance score.

3. **Intensity**: 0.7  
There's a notable intensity in how the argument articulates the disparity in societal attitudes toward male and female victims of rape. The language used conveys strong feelings about the perceived expectations of masculinity and the shame associated with male victimhood, which contributes to a higher intensity score.

4. **Concreteness**: 0.4  
While the argument discusses specific societal judgments and expectations, it remains somewhat abstract in terms of personal narratives or specific examples. The concepts of masculinity, shame, and societal expectations are somewhat generalized rather than presented with unique personal accounts or concrete scenarios, leading to a lower score in concreteness.

Overall, this assessment reflects a nuanced approach to a complex topic, balancing the need for awareness of male victimhood with a critique of societal norms.
