Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument's text, I will break it down into sections and analyze each one individually.

**First Quarter:**
"I guess I need to clarify a bit, as lots of people have posted regarding what it means to be 'offended'/'outraged.' I have no problem with people being personally offended by something, either because it invokes a memory, or they simply find it difficult to sit through."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; acknowledges a range of feelings)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Low dominance; the speaker is clarifying rather than asserting control)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mild; expresses understanding without strong emotion)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat concrete; discusses feelings and responses)

**Second Quarter:**
"To clarify my position, being offended by something, and then taking to the internet to say that the show's creators were WRONG to show it, is ridiculous."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative; expresses a strong opinion against vocal outrage)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderate dominance; the speaker asserts their viewpoint)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High; the use of "ridiculous" conveys strong disapproval)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Moderately concrete; focuses on actions and opinions)

**Third Quarter:**
"I think the AV Club nails it this week as to why this scene was not okay [link]: Game Of Thrones has whiffed with this type of development in the past [rape], failing to treat an established reality within its universe with the proper amount of gravity."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Somewhat negative; indicates disappointment in the show's treatment of rape)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced; acknowledges another source while contributing a personal opinion)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately strong; expresses dissatisfaction with the show's approach)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete; refers to specific content and critiques from a source)

**Fourth Quarter:**
"Both the scene and the rape itself didn't *have* to happen. And it was depicted so horrifyingly. You state that you think murder is worse than rape, but while the end result is worse because it's final, I think the experience of being raped or tortured (rape IS torture) is worse than the experience of being murdered."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (Very negative; critiques the depiction of rape)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Low to moderate dominance; presenting a counter-argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (Very high; strongly expresses horror and personal reaction)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Highly concrete; provides detailed and vivid opinions)

### Summary of Ratings:
**First Quarter:** Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.3, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.6  
**Second Quarter:** Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.5  
**Third Quarter:** Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.7  
**Fourth Quarter:** Valence 0.1, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.8

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating for each of the requested dimensions based on the provided argument:

1. **Valence (0.0 to 1.0)**: 0.4
   - The overall tone of the argument is somewhat negative, especially towards those who express outrage about the scene, which suggests a disapproving sentiment towards certain reactions. However, it does allow for some acknowledgment of differing opinions and the complexity of emotions related to such scenes.

2. **Dominance (0.0 to 1.0)**: 0.8
   - The argument maintains a strong assertive voice, positioning the author’s perspective as a rebuttal to those who criticize the depiction of the scene. The use of phrases like "one of the stupidest things" indicates a high level of confidence and authority in their viewpoint.

3. **Intensity (0.0 to 1.0)**: 0.7
   - The emotional stakes are quite high in the discussion around a sensitive topic like rape. The argument conveys a sense of urgency and passion about the nature of the discussion surrounding the scene, demonstrating a high intensity in its language and claims.

4. **Concreteness (0.0 to 1.0)**: 0.5
   - While the argument references specific scenes and character developments, it relies more on abstract notions of morality and personal interpretation. It discusses the implications of outrage and opinions, making it somewhat less concrete than a more fact-based approach.

These ratings reflect the nuances of the argument's tone, authority, emotional weight, and clarity.
