Sure! I’ll evaluate the argument across the four categories you mentioned: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. I'll break it down into four quarters as requested.

### 1st Quarter
"The 'female in a male's body' thing is outdated. Trans people don't really think that, it was a trope invented by cis people."

- **Valence (0.8)**: The statement has a negative connotation towards the idea of being 'trapped' in another body, which suggests frustration with the trope. 
- **Dominance (0.7)**: The speaker expresses a confident stance against the stereotype, asserting authority over the topic.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The language is assertive, challenging established narratives related to transgender identities.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: The notion of it being a trope is somewhat abstract, but it references a clear social construct.

### 2nd Quarter
"Being trans means identifying as a gender not the one given to you at birth."

- **Valence (0.9)**: This statement carries a positive affirmation of trans identities, emphasizing self-identification.
- **Dominance (0.8)**: The assertion is strong and clear-cut, reinforcing the validity of transgender identities.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The expression is solid; however, it lacks the fervor of the preceding claims, presenting a straightforward definition.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: The concept is clear and straightforward—it's a definitional statement that resonates with the experience of many trans individuals.

### 3rd Quarter
"The reason trans people do 'stereotypical' feminine/masculine stuff is because we need to pass as the gender we identify as or we fear violence and ridicule."

- **Valence (0.6)**: This portion has a negative aspect regarding societal pressure and fear, maintaining a somber tone.
- **Dominance (0.7)**: The speaker presents a strong understanding of the challenges faced by trans individuals, suggesting intimate knowledge of the situation.
- **Intensity (0.8)**: The emotional weight regarding fear and violence elevates the power of the argument.
- **Concreteness (0.8)**: The reasons given are grounded in social realities, making the argument very tangible and relevant.

### 4th Quarter
"Nobody thinks it should have to be like this, but the system cannot change radically overnight."

- **Valence (0.7)**: There is a mix of hope and resignation here; the negative situation is acknowledged, but it doesn’t dwell on despair.
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The tone suggests a level of acceptance of systemic constraints, which diminishes assertiveness somewhat.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The intensity lowers as the argument shifts to a more resigned tone about the slow pace of change.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: The acknowledgment of systemic change is practical and relatable, but it remains somewhat abstract in terms of individual experiences.

### Summary of Scores
**1st Quarter**: Valence 0.8 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.7 | Concreteness 0.6  
**2nd Quarter**: Valence 0.9 | Dominance 0.8 | Intensity 0.6 | Concreteness 0.7
