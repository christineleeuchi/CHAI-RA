Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here is a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1:

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To provide a rating for each quarter of the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break it down into the four parts as requested. 

### 1st Quarter:
**Text**: "One of the ways to combat the underlying problem is to ensure those who can combat it are in the right places. That means, in this case, creating a countervailing bias to fix the original one."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (The statement has a generally positive tone as it proposes a solution to an issue.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (It suggests a corrective action but does not assert power over others.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The language conveys urgency in addressing biases but remains somewhat neutral.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The terms are somewhat abstract, with "underlying problem" being vague; however, "combat" provides concrete imagery.)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text**: "People have biases about how well women can do a job?  Putting women in those jobs will convince them they are wrong."

- **Valence**: 0.8 (The proposal to change perceptions is positive and optimistic.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (There is a sense of agency in the assertion that presence can change bias, showing some dominance.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The statement is sincere and assertive about the need to change biases.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The suggestion to "put women in those jobs" provides a direct and clear action.)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text**: "Women are less willing to enter a field because it is male dominated?"

- **Valence**: 0.5 (The question suggests a recognition of an issue without significantly positive or negative connotations.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (It poses a question rather than asserting a stance of dominance or control.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The phrasing is mild, reflecting inquiry rather than strong emotions.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (This portion is a bit more concrete since it addresses a specific issue but still relies on speculation.)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text**: "Temporary positive discrimination will fix the problem."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (While acknowledging a solution, the term "positive discrimination" is contentious and can evoke mixed feelings.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (This statement asserts a definitive stance on how to address the issue, showing dominance in understanding.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The use of "will fix" communicates strong confidence in the proposed solution.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 ("Temporary positive discrimination" is specific enough to understand the context but is still a complex term.)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **1st Quarter**: Valence 0.7, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.6, Concreteness 0.5
- **2nd Quarter**: Valence 0.8, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.7, Concreteness 0.7
- **3rd Quarter**: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6
- **4th Quarter**: Valence 0.6, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.8, Concreteness 0.7
