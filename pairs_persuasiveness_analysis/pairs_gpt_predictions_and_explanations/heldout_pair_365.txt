Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument across four dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I will evaluate each quarter of the text as you requested:

### Quarter 1: "An empirical data point counter to your view is the space race between the US and the USSR in the mid 20th century."
1. **Valence (0.6)**: The statement acknowledges a counterpoint, suggesting a neutral to slightly negative view of the original argument against nationalism, as it implies the potential benefits of national pride.
2. **Dominance (0.5)**: This part introduces a counterargument but does not assert dominance over the original view; it presents an alternate perspective.
3. **Intensity (0.5)**: The level of intensity is moderate as it simply states the context (the space race) without strong emotional language.
4. **Concreteness (0.7)**: It references a specific historical event, making it concrete.

### Quarter 2: "Motivated by national pride, the two countries fought so hard to win the race..."
1. **Valence (0.5)**: The mention of "national pride" has a mixed connotation; while it is positive in a motivational sense, it’s also tied to competition, which can be seen negatively.
2. **Dominance (0.6)**: Here, national pride begins to show its influence, presenting the argument in favor of how nationalism can drive significant efforts.
3. **Intensity (0.6)**: The language conveys some sense of urgency and competition, making it somewhat intense.
4. **Concreteness (0.6)**: The mention of "fought so hard" and "win the race" provides a sense of specific actions, but it remains somewhat abstract as it lacks detailed examples.

### Quarter 3: "...during that time so many technologies have made advancements..."
1. **Valence (0.7)**: This part is more positive, emphasizing the benefits associated with national pride and competition.
2. **Dominance (0.7)**: It strengthens the argument in favor of national pride by highlighting its positive outcomes, showcasing its dominance over the initial viewpoint.
3. **Intensity (0.6)**: The phrasing conveys optimism about the achievements resulting from that competition, but it’s still restrained.
4. **Concreteness (0.5)**: While it implies significant advancements, it lacks specific examples of technologies, making it less concrete.

### Quarter 4: "...and resulted in technologies we still rely on today."
1. **Valence (0.8)**: This closes on a strong positive note, as it underscores the lasting benefits of the competition.
2. **Dominance (0.8)**: It asserts a clear advantage of nationalism by showcasing tangible, ongoing benefits.
3. **Intensity (0.7)**: There’s a strong affirmation of value here, highlighting the lasting impact which elevates the argument's importance.
4. **Concreteness (0.8)**: It effectively ties the historical context to present realities, making it highly concrete.

### Summary of Ratings:
- Quarter 1: Valence (0.6), Dominance (0.5), Intensity (0.5), Concreteness (0.7)
- Quarter 2: Valence (0.5), Dominance (0.6), Intensity (0.6), Concreteness (0.6)
- Quarter 3: Valence (0.7), Dominance (0.7), Intensity (0.6), Concreteness (0.5)
- Quarter 4: Valence (0.8), Dominance (0.8), Intensity (0.7), Concreteness (0.8)

Sure! Here’s a breakdown of the argument into four quarters along with ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:
