Here’s an evaluation of the argument using the specified ratings:

1. **Valence (Emotional Tone)**: 0.4
   - The argument carries a somewhat negative valence due to its condescending tone towards the recipient's knowledge and understanding of racism. However, it also offers a constructive suggestion for improvement by recommending readings.

2. **Dominance (Assertiveness)**: 0.7
   - The argument is assertive, particularly in its confidence regarding the recipient's knowledge level and the recommendation of authors. It positions itself as more knowledgeable, which adds to the dominance.

3. **Intensity (Strength of Emotion)**: 0.5
   - The intensity is moderate. While the statement suggests frustration or criticism, it lacks extreme emotion and is more focused on educating than expressing strong feelings.

4. **Concreteness (Specificity/Clarity)**: 0.6
