Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument provided, we can break it down into four quarters and assign scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

1. **First Quarter**: "Just like everyone's saying, English already *has* gender-neutral pronouns."
   - **Valence**: 0.8 (The tone is positive, indicating that there is already a solution in place.)
   - **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker asserts a common understanding but does not assert dominance over the argument explicitly.)
   - **Intensity**: 0.5 (The argument is presented in a straightforward manner without strong emotional language.)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.7 (The mention of existing pronouns provides a clear, tangible example.)

2. **Second Quarter**: "We have 'one', 'singular they' and 'generic he' which are all generally well understood and fulfill their function."
   - **Valence**: 0.8 (The assertion that these pronouns are understood creates a positive impression about their utility.)
   - **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker has a strong position about the effectiveness of these pronouns.)
   - **Intensity**: 0.6 (Quite definitive, but not overly emotionally charged.)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Specific examples of pronouns provide a high level of concreteness.)

3. **Third Quarter**: "I tend to go for 'singular they' as 'generic he' seems a bit problematic, especially when talking about professionals - seems exclusive of females, even if it's **meant** to be gender neutral."
   - **Valence**: 0.5 (While the speaker expresses a preference, there is a note of criticism regarding "generic he.")
   - **Dominance**: 0.5 (The opinion shared is personal; thus, it doesn't assert dominance over a broader perspective.)
   - **Intensity**: 0.7 (The term "problematic" adds an emotional quality to the argument.)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The mention of "professionals" grounds the discussion in a specific context.)

4. **Fourth Quarter**: "So yeah. Why introduce a new word when we already have the words?"
   - **Valence**: 0.5 (The concluding statement has a neutral tone, questioning the need for new language.)
   - **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker is again asserting their opinion about the redundancy of new pronouns.)
   - **Intensity**: 0.4 (The rhetorical question softens the intensity of the argument.)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The argument is more abstract in this quarter, though it suggests a practical consideration.)

### Summary of Scores:
1. First Quarter: Valence: 0.8 | Dominance: 0.6 | Intensity: 0.5 | Concreteness: 0.7
2. Second Quarter: Valence: 0.8 | Dominance: 0.7 | Intensity: 0.6 | Concreteness: 0.9
3. Third Quarter: Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.5 | Intensity: 0.7 | Concreteness: 0.8
4. Fourth Quarter: Valence: 0.5 | Dominance: 0.6 | Intensity: 0.4 | Concreteness: 0.5

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can examine each quarter of the text. Hereâ€™s a breakdown with scores:

1. **Valence (positive/negative emotional tone)**:
   - **Score: 0.5** - The argument expresses both agreement (with the acceptance of gender-neutral pronouns in some contexts) and a negative feeling towards the specific pronouns 'xe' and similar terms.

2. **Dominance (assertiveness/agency)**:
   - **Score: 0.6** - The speaker asserts their opinion clearly, contributing to a sense of agency regarding their stance on language aesthetics and pronoun usage.

3. **Intensity (strength of the argument)**:
   - **Score: 0.4** - The argument presents a moderate intensity. It includes a strong personal opinion about language aesthetics but does not aggressively contest the overall idea of gender-neutral pronouns.

4. **Concreteness (clarity and specificity)**:
   - **Score: 0.7** - The argument is fairly concrete, providing clear insights into the speaker's stance on language use, the role of gendered pronouns, and their preference regarding the use of terms like 'xe.'

Overall, the argument conveys a nuanced view of pronoun use, encompassing aspects of acceptance and personal preference, all while remaining reasonably clear and assertive.
