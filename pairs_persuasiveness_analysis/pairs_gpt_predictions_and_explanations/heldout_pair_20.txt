Here are the ratings for each aspect of the argument based on your descriptions:

### 1. Valence:
**Score: 0.6**
- The argument presents a generally positive view of homeschooling and is critical of the idea of making it illegal. However, it also includes some negative aspects directed at the opposing view (stereotypes about homeschooling), which slightly lowers the valence. Overall, the tone is more supportive of homeschooling.

### 2. Dominance:
**Score: 0.7**
- The argument has a strong assertive tone, confidently challenging the opposing viewpoint and asserting the benefits of homeschooling over public schooling. The author frequently claims expertise based on personal experience, which adds to the sense of dominance.

### 3. Intensity:
**Score: 0.8**
- The argument exhibits a high level of intensity, particularly in its response to perceived misunderstandings and stereotypes about homeschooling and public schooling. Phrases like "disregarding any issues of parental rights" and "approach the issue from a perspective of assumed ignorance" convey a passionate stance on the topic.

### 4. Concreteness:
**Score: 0.5**
- While the argument presents some concrete statements (like the mention of standardized testing performance), much of it relies on general claims about the benefits of homeschooling versus public schooling without providing detailed evidence or examples. This makes the argument feel somewhat abstract at times, lowering its concreteness score.

Overall, these scores reflect an argument that is mostly positive and assertive but relies on a mix of personal experience and general claims without extensive concrete evidence.
