Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the dimensions — valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness — for each quarter of the argument provided:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "With all automated mechanical systems, it's important to have fail-safes to allow human intervention in the case of emergencies that are not anticipated by the software."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The statement is mostly positive regarding safety but acknowledges potential risks.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker expresses authority on the importance of safety protocols.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The tone is moderate; it emphasizes importance without excessive emotional appeal.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The idea of fail-safes is concrete, but the mention of "emergencies" remains somewhat abstract.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Nowadays, auto-pilot can fly airlines pretty much from gate-to-gate. The reason that we don't do this is that the software cannot anticipate **all** possible emergency situations and pilot intuition cannot be replaced."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The use of auto-pilot is presented positively, but the limitations introduce a cautionary tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker presents a strong case based on their understanding of current technology limitations.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument carries a moderate intensity as it discusses the confidence in auto-pilot while emphasizing its limitations.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The examples of auto-pilot and its limitations provide substantial concrete details.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "I believe the same thing will ring true with self-driving cars."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The statement is neutral; it doesn’t strongly lean positive or negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts a belief but does not provide a strong authoritative argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The phrase "I believe" indicates a lower intensity in emotional engagement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (This statement is abstract, as it lacks specific examples or evidence.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "Eventually, they will take over a majority of our driving, but I think that it'll be a long time before we have self-driving cars that cannot be manually controlled."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The prediction of widespread adoption of self-driving cars is positive, but the caution indicates a more complex view.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker maintains a viewpoint that presents them as knowledgeable about future trends.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The tone is measured and contemplative, lacking high emotional intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The phrase offers a vision of the future, but it remains somewhat vague without detailed scenarios.)

These ratings encapsulate the emotional reactions, authority, emotional weight, and specificity found in each section of the argument.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To rate the argument in four dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I'll break down each quarter of the argument and provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Quarter 1: "While I agree with you that safe-driving cars will likely eventually become mainstream, I'm not sure where you got your timeline from because it seems grossly exaggerated."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral: The speaker acknowledges the mainstream potential of safe-driving cars but expresses skepticism about the timeline.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Moderately low: The speaker questions the other person's perspective but does so in a way that suggests uncertainty rather than outright assertion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Low: The term "grossly exaggerated" indicates some intensity but is moderated by the overall agreement on mainstream acceptance.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Moderate: The argument is clear in context but doesn't provide specific details that support the skepticism.)

### Quarter 2: "There is no way that self-driving cars are going to replace human-driven cars in 16 years."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Negative: This statement is quite definitive and strongly disagrees with the timeline proposed.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (High: The speaker asserts a strong disagreement, positioning themselves as a dominant voice in the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High: The phrase "there is no way" carries significant intensity, clearly expressing conviction.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Moderate to High: The claim is specific regarding the timeline but lacks detailed reasons for this assertion.)

### Quarter 3: "Even if the technology advances that quickly (very unlikely)..."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative: The speaker considers the rapid technological advancement unlikely, suggesting skepticism.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate: The speaker is still coming from a place of questioning without fully asserting dominance over the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate: The speaker expresses doubt but does not come across as extremely intense about it.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Moderate: The phrase "very unlikely" is vague and doesn’t provide solid grounding, though it does imply some level of reasoning.)

### Quarter 4: "...it's still going to take a good 20+ years for society to accept them."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Moderate Negative: This statement implies a belief that acceptance will be slow, but it doesn't carry the same weight as stronger negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderate to High: The speaker prescribes a timeline for societal acceptance, asserting a commanding voice regarding public sentiment.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate: The phrasing is definitive yet does not convey overwhelming intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (High: The mention of "20+ years" provides a clear timeframe that adds substance to the argument.)
