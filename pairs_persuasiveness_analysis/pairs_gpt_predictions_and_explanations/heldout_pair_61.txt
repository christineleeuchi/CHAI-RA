Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Let's break down the argument into its four quarters and provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each.

### Quarter 1:
* "It's true that elections these days are all about Ohio/Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia/NC, and Nevada/New Hampshire, and it's true that demographic shifts in many of those states are increasingly favoring the Democrats."

- **Valence**: 0.7 - This is a generally neutral statement with a slight lean towards a positive view for Democrats based on demographic shifts.
- **Dominance**: 0.4 - The statement presents facts without asserting dominance; it's informative rather than commanding.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - The intensity is moderate; the factual nature of the statement doesn't invoke strong emotions.
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 - The references to specific states and demographic trends make this section concrete and clear.

### Quarter 2:
* "Republicans are smart & focused about targeting competitive areas and maximizing every possible systemic advantage they can muster (voter suppression, redistricting, controlling local establishment, big dollar advertising) and tend to have more consistent voter turnout (the elderly and angry white people)."

- **Valence**: 0.5 - This section is mixed; it acknowledges Republican strategy but mentions voter suppression, which has negative connotations.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 - There is an assertion of Republican effectiveness in strategy, implying a sense of dominance.
- **Intensity**: 0.6 - The use of terms like "voter suppression" adds a bit of intensity, signaling moral outrage.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - The mention of specific tactics and demographic groups provides a tangible basis for the argument.

### Quarter 3:
* "The Democrats' voter turnout is more inconsistent though, as they tend to rely on groups that only get out and vote when really excited (the young, economically disadvantaged)."

- **Valence**: 0.4 - This is more negative regarding Democrats, pointing out a significant weakness in their strategy.
- **Dominance**: 0.5 - It implies a level of control of the situation by Republicans based on the Democrats' shortcomings.
- **Intensity**: 0.5 - Moderate intensity; the phrasing highlights an issue without being overly emotional.
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 - Mentioning specific voter demographics adds clarity, though it remains somewhat generalized.

### Quarter 4:
* "It's really up to the Democrats if they want to win or lose a presidential election. We've seen *exactly* what happens when they think the Republicans can't win: they get complacent and nominate a boring establishment candidate that fails to energize their flakier base, and they fuck it up."

- **Valence**: 0.3 - This portion is relatively negative towards Democrats, highlighting their past failures and implying a lack of competence.
- **Dominance**: 0.7 - There is a strong assertion of how Democratic complacency leads to failure, establishing a dominating narrative.
- **Intensity**: 0.8 - The strong language ("they fuck it up") conveys high intensity and emotional charge.
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 - While it refers to past candidates and events, it remains somewhat abstract in predicting future outcomes.

### Summary of Ratings:
| Quarter | Valence | Dominance | Intensity | Concreteness |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1       | 0.7     | 0.4       | 0.5       | 0.8          |
| 2       | 0.5     | 0.6       | 0.6       | 0.7          |
| 3       | 0.4     | 0.5       | 0.5       | 0.6          |
| 4       | 0.3     | 0.7       | 0.8       | 0.5          |

Overall, this argument presents a critical view of the Democratic party while acknowledging Republican strategies, resulting in a range of emotional and factual presentations.

To evaluate the argument you provided on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can analyze the various parts of the argument in four quarters. Here’s my assessment:

### Quarter 1
**Argument:** "John Kasich and a Marco Rubio ticket would be a near 100% victory both are popular in their home states John Kasich has a 64% approval rate in Ohio and Rubio has a 56% approval rating in Florida."

- **Valence (0.8):** The statement has a positive connotation, suggesting a highly favorable outcome for a Republican ticket.
- **Dominance (0.7):** The argument asserts a strong position about the potential success of this ticket, indicating confidence.
- **Intensity (0.6):** The intensity is moderate; while it conveys a sense of certainty about the ticket's success, it doesn't invoke strong emotional language.
- **Concreteness (0.8):** The use of specific approval ratings adds a level of factual basis that provides a tangible measure of their popularity.

### Quarter 2
**Argument:** "Remember the last old white guy to win the presidency was Carter in '76, Bill Clinton won the youth and middle vote due to his young charm and ability to handle a room and a lot of minorities got out to vote, because they thought he was different and can bring change..."

- **Valence (0.6):** This section presents a neutral to slightly positive perspective on Clinton, but it also reflects on a perceived shift in demographics.
- **Dominance (0.5):** There's an attempt to establish a historical context, but it doesn't strongly assert dominance in the argument about the current election.
- **Intensity (0.7):** The mention of charm and the idea of change carries some emotional weight, making it somewhat intense.
- **Concreteness (0.5):** While it references specific historical events, the argument lacks precise metrics or evidence to back its claims about appeal.

### Quarter 3
**Argument:** "Look at the 2000 and 2004 elections where the Democrats had an old white guy they lost, but in 2008 and 2012 they had Obama running and he won due to record black and Hispanic turnout…"

- **Valence (0.5):** The tone is mostly neutral, focusing on factual historical outcomes without a strong emotional charge.
- **Dominance (0.6):** It attempts to assert a pattern in electoral outcomes concerning demographic shifts, showing some dominance over the analysis.
- **Intensity (0.6):** There is moderate intensity as it connects the elections to demographic impacts, making it more engaging.
- **Concreteness (0.7):** It references specific elections and ethnic demographics, adding a level of concrete detail to the argument.

### Quarter 4
**Argument:** "Why do you think that The DNC is pushing for Hillary over Biden even though Biden has higher approval ratings? Because, on election day they want more women to show up."

- **Valence (0.4):** This part has a speculative and somewhat negative tone about the DNC’s strategy, which may not be agreeable to all.
- **Dominance (0.5):** The argument attempts to assert a claim about political strategy but lacks strong evidence or conviction.
- **Intensity (0.5):** There is some intensity in posing a question that challenges current DNC strategies, but it remains moderate.
- **Concreteness (0.4):** This quarter is more abstract and relies on speculation rather than concrete facts, leading to lower concreteness.

### Summary
Here’s the final rating for each element:

- **Valence:** 0.60
- **Dominance:** 0.55
- **Intensity:** 0.55
- **Concreteness:** 0.56

These scores reflect the overall strength and clarity of the argument while considering its different components.
