Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument effectively, I'll break it down into four quarters and assess each based on valence (emotional quality), dominance (assertiveness or authority), intensity (strength of the argument), and concreteness (clarity and specificity). Here's the rating for each quarter of the argument:

### Quarter 1: "The rates of child abuse (and crime in general) have decreased markedly since 1990 even in countries which have not legalized the viewing of child porn, such as the US."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it states a fact about crime rates without strong emotional language)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Some assertiveness in presenting data against the previous argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity, presenting a factual observation)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific and clear, citing a time frame and example)

### Quarter 2: "That study you linked (or the abstract at least)..."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Slightly negative, as it critiques the previous study)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Reasonably assertive but somewhat tentative with the phrase “or the abstract at least”)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Less intense, suggesting a mild critique)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat clear, though it implies not engaging with the full study)

### Quarter 3: "...did nothing to show that the legalization of the viewing of child porn actually caused the decrease."
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative, directly rejecting the implication of the original argument)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strongly assertive in its claim about causation)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in the definitive language of "did nothing to show")
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear in stating the argument against causation)

### Summary Ratings:
1. **Quarter 1:**
   - Valence: 0.5
   - Dominance: 0.6
   - Intensity: 0.5
   - Concreteness: 0.7

2. **Quarter 2:**
   - Valence: 0.3
   - Dominance: 0.5
   - Intensity: 0.4
   - Concreteness: 0.6

3. **Quarter 3:**
   - Valence: 0.2
   - Dominance: 0.8
   - Intensity: 0.6
   - Concreteness: 0.7

Overall, the argument presents a clear critique based on observable data while varying in emotional quality and assertiveness across different parts.

Here’s a rating score for each of the aspects of the argument broken down into four quarters.

**1. Valence (Emotional tone)**
- **Score:** 0.4
- **Explanation:** The emotional tone of the argument is critical and somewhat confrontational, highlighting skepticism and frustration regarding the initial source. It conveys a negative sentiment towards the effectiveness of the referenced study. 

**2. Dominance (Assertiveness of the argument)**
- **Score:** 0.7
- **Explanation:** This portion of the argument is assertive, challenging the original claim and demanding further explanation. It demonstrates a strong stance against the validity of the provided source, indicating a dominant position in the discussion.

**3. Intensity (Strength of the argument)**
- **Score:** 0.6
- **Explanation:** The intensity comes from pointing out perceived flaws and calling the source's reliability into question. However, it lacks strong evidence to back up claims about long-term effects, which slightly reduces its overall intensity.

**4. Concreteness (Level of specificity and detail)**
- **Score:** 0.5
- **Explanation:** The argument mentions specific time frames and events, offering concrete details about the declines and inclines in reported cases. However, it could be improved with more comprehensive data or examples to substantiate claims, making it moderately concrete.

These ratings are subjective and based on the text's qualities, and opinions may vary based on interpretation.
