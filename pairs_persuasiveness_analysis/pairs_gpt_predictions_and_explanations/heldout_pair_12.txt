Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To assign scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the provided argument, I'll evaluate the text based on emotional tone (valence), the extent to which the argument asserts control or power (dominance), how strong or forceful the message is (intensity), and how well-defined or specific the concepts are (concreteness).

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "Do you believe extinction is better than existence in captivity? If so, I doubt I can help but if not please read on."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral tone; asking a controversial question)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Asking a question implies less dominance; seeking engagement)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in challenging the reader’s perspective)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Abstract concept presented—existence in captivity vs. extinction)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Because existence in captivity is certainly capable of providing more for an animal than the wild."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive tone towards captivity; implies benefits)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The claim is persuasive, suggesting authority over the subject)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong assertion about the superiority of captivity)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More specific in discussing the benefits but still abstract)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "Stored food for the winter, provided water and medical treatment, protection from predators."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Very positive framing of captivity)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Firmly establishes captivity as advantageous)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity; listing clear benefits)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Specific and tangible examples provided)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "And a swift death when the time comes. I work at a small dairy farm. There are many farmers still out there that care for their animals. It's consumers that have shifted the markets, as consumers become more disconnected from their food they allow industrial farms to take over. If you care, support your local farmers or you will just be leaving only the people that don't care to decide where our meat and other animal products come from."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Mixed tone; mentions swift death but frames overall care of animals positively)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (Strong assertion regarding consumer responsibility and farmer care)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (Highly intense; urging action and accountability)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific in terms of local farming vs. industrial farming, but a bit abstract towards the end)

- Valence: 0.5
- Dominance: 0.3

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness in relation to the suffering of animals, I will break down the argument into four quarters and score each category from 0.0 to 1.0:

**1st Quarter: "That's your problem. Only a small percentage of people care about the suffering of animals."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 - This section presents a somewhat negative view towards concern for animal suffering, implying it's not a priority for most people.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - This statement asserts a perspective that challenges the moral argument from a dominant viewpoint of majority opinion.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - The tone communicates a dismissive attitude, but it lacks strong emotional language.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The argument is somewhat concrete in its claim about the percentage of people who care, but does not provide specific evidence or sources for support.

**2nd Quarter: "The amount of people who make food choices and calculate animal suffering into the equation about what to buy is about 1-3 percent and has stayed that number for a long time."**

- **Valence:** 0.4 - This section mildly emphasizes a negative outlook on the impact of animal suffering concerns.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The claim presents a factual number, establishing authority over the discussion by presenting "stay that number for a long time" as if it's an established truth.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - Although it reflects a continuous trend, it does not invoke intense emotional response toward animal suffering.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - This claim is more concrete because it provides a specific statistical range, though still lacking sourced backing.

**3rd Quarter: "You're making a moral argument where one really doesn't exist for the far, far majority of people."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 - This statement argues against the existence of a moral grounding for most people, suggesting a very negative perception of ethical considerations regarding animal suffering.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - It asserts a strong claim about the moral landscape of society, suggesting that individual values do not align with the majority's.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The use of "really doesn't exist" adds weight to the argument, making it somewhat intense but not overwhelmingly so.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - The assertion is somewhat vague and is not backed by specific data, making it a less concrete observation.

**4th Quarter: "Even if you do, you being a vegan isn't going to change anything. There are 1.4 billion cows in the world. Do you really think your individual choice is going to affect that number?"**

- **Valence:** 0.2 - This section presents a very negative view regarding individual impact on animal suffering.
- **Dominance:** 0.8 - It emphasizes the insignificance of individual action against the larger context, portraying strong dominance over the debate.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - The rhetorical question conveys an assertive tone, which increases emotional intensity.
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 - This part is very concrete with a specific figure (1.4 billion cows) that helps illustrate the argument's point clearly.

**Overall Averages:**

- **Valence:** 0.3
- **Dominance:** 0.65
- **Intensity:** 0.475
- **Concreteness:** 0.675

This breakdown illustrates the argument's structure and how it relates to the issues surrounding animal suffering while highlighting its weaknesses in emotional engagement and support.
