Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here's the rating for each of the quarters of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1
**Argument:** "There are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?"

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument presents a balance of negative aspects related to financial disadvantage, but it frames the situation in a way that encourages empathy.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker positions themselves as knowledgeable by discussing the challenges of re-entering the workforce and invites the reader to consider this perspective.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The term "tremendous financial disadvantage" conveys a significant emotional impact, highlighting the severity of the situation.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This is a very concrete example that many can relate to, as it discusses specific life situations and challenges.)

### Quarter 2
**Argument:** "Additionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The tone remains neutral, presenting potential difficulties without overly negative framing.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It asserts the complexity and weight of custody issues and acknowledges serious implications for children.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The mention of abusive spouses introduces a stronger emotional response, especially regarding the impact on children.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific examples of custody complications add clarity to the argument, making it relatable.)

### Quarter 3
**Argument:** "Ultimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument highlights an imbalance of power, which is troubling, but it calls for justice.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong viewpoint on the injustice faced by stay-at-home parents.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The implications of being "discouraged from pursuing a divorce" have strong emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument relies on a less tangible assessment of feelings and situations, though it acknowledges practical consequences.)

### Quarter 4
**Argument:** "Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children. But your solution doesn't solve this problem; someone caught in a relationship with an abusive or cheating spouse will have no recourse regarding custody of kids or financial compensation and therefore will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (This has more negative framing towards punitive measures and the lack of solutions for undesirable relationships.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker confidently challenges the opposing view, establishing themselves as an advocate for fairness.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (The criticism of the opposing argument and the mention of abusive scenarios adds significant emotional gravity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (While it remains specific about the issues at hand, discussing punitive measures is somewhat broader and less observable than earlier sections.)

### Summary
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.8, Intensity: 0.9, Concreteness: 0.7
