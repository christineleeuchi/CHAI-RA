To evaluate the argument regarding the California Indecent Exposure Law and its application to breastfeeding, we'll analyze the four dimensions: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. Here's a breakdown for each quarter of the argument's text.

**First Quarter:** "Every person who willfully and lewdly, either: 1. Exposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby; or,"

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The language is neutral to slightly negative, focusing on the prohibition of exposure, which generally has a negative connotation.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The law is authoritative and sets a clear boundary regarding what is permissible in public.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The use of specific legal terms like "willfully" and "lewdly" indicates a moderate intensity, emphasizing the seriousness of the conduct discussed.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While the legal text is specific, it remains abstract in its interpretation and application.)

**Second Quarter:** "Pay careful attention to the first sentence, because it's the most important."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (This portion is more instructional and neutral; it calls for attention without a strong positive or negative sentiment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (There’s a moderate degree of authority in the instruction to pay attention, implying the importance of the law.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The language is soft and advisory, lacking emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (While it emphasizes importance, the statement does not introduce new concrete elements; it's more about the focus on existing content.)

**Third Quarter:** "A woman that 'breastfed' in the manner of a striptease in public might well be violating indecent exposure laws."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (This part carries a slightly negative connotation as it juxtaposes breastfeeding with an inappropriate act, but it’s still somewhat neutral.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The hypothetical example posits a scenario that challenges the law but does not exhibit strong authoritative power.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The comparison heightens emotional impact slightly, suggesting an inappropriate scenario that evokes some level of concern.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The imagery used is specific and paints a clear picture, making the argument more tangible.)

**Fourth Quarter:** "Doing so normally is not, because it's not lewd."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This conclusion has a positive implication regarding standard breastfeeding practices but remains somewhat neutral overall.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The argument is less about asserting authority and more about clarifying a misconception.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (It's a straightforward statement that lacks strong emotional cues but reinforces a key point of the argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The conclusion is clear and straightforward, solidifying the argument with a specific assertion about the nature of breastfeeding.)

Overall, this breakdown allows for an understanding of how the argument about breastfeeding and indecent exposure is structured and assessed across various emotional and cognitive dimensions.

Here's a breakdown of the argument for each of the requested dimensions: 

1. **Valence (0.6)**: The argument is generally positive in its framing, as it emphasizes the rights and legality of breastfeeding in public. However, it does challenge the original argument's premise, which could introduce a defensive or negative reaction in the opposing viewpoint.

2. **Dominance (0.4)**: The argument asserts a level of authority by citing laws and statistics, suggesting a stronger stance in the debate. However, it maintains a conversational tone and does not aggressively dominate the discourse, so it receives a moderate score.

3. **Intensity (0.5)**: The argument presents a firm position supported by references to legal exemptions. While the argument is direct, it does not employ strong emotional language or rhetoric that would elevate the intensity significantly.

4. **Concreteness (0.7)**: The argument provides specific information about laws in various states, making it quite concrete. The use of statistics and references to legal exemptions gives the argument a tangible foundation, enhancing its clarity and specificity. 

These scores reflect an analysis of how the argument communicates its points across the aforementioned dimensions.
