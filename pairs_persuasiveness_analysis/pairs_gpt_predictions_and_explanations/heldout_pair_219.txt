Sure! I'll provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for the valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of each quarter of the argument you've provided.

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "Hiya! I think I disagree because I don't think that this aspect alone could trump (no pun intended, honestly) any amount of good a President could do."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive tone, but disagreement is introduced)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (A measured and amiable tone)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; casual phrasing)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some abstract concepts about good a President could do)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "For instance, if you had 10 candidates that exaggerate their finances while you have 1 candidate who doesn't, but has policies that would essentially end the world due to their nuke trigger-happy beliefs, I definitely would not vote the last one for fear of Cold War: The Sequel (This time, it's personal)."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative tone due to catastrophic consequences)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Argumentative tone, presenting a clear hypothetical situation)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity when discussing the potential catastrophic outcomes)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific example provided; tangible fear of nuclear consequences)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "I definitely would never vote Trump and Scott Walker either, but not for those reasons alone. Had they had incredible policies that would improve this nation better than the other candidates, I would have chosen them as the President despite this one aspect."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral tone, expresses a clear stance)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Affirmative tone; showing a strong personal stance)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate intensity; more analytical than emotional)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Refers to specific candidates and potential policies)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Unfortunately, the examples you gave are bad Presidents altogether, but concrete examples aside, the concept is there. This trait can be outweighed by goodness."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Slightly negative for the reference to bad Presidents)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced tone; critiquing and reiterating a concept)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Lower intensity; more reflective and summarizing)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Refers to bad examples but becomes more abstract in the conclusion)

These scoring assessments provide an overall evaluation of each component of the argument as requested!

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Certainly! Here are the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument:

**1st Quarter (Scott Walker's argument about credit card debt):**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is slightly positive, as it emphasizes financial responsibility despite the debt.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument presents a counterpoint but doesn’t overly assert dominance; it’s more of an explanation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The intensity is mild; it's a reasoned stance rather than an emotionally charged argument.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific figures are given, which adds to the concreteness of the argument.)

**2nd Quarter (Response about Donald Trump's worth):**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral tone, as it acknowledges the point about Trump without a strong emotional charge.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This part is more of an acknowledgment rather than an assertive statement.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low intensity; it’s a factual statement rather than one that provokes strong feelings.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It references a specific number but lacks deeper context or detail.)

**3rd Quarter (Edit about presidential power over the budget):**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it states a fact about the presidential role.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It asserts a position about the limitations of presidential power, giving it some dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; it challenges the initial claim regarding responsibility for budgeting.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete, providing a clear understanding of the power dynamics in budget setting.)

Overall, the argument makes reasonable points but varies in its emotional tone and assertiveness across the segments.
