To analyze the argument related to homeschooling for military families, I'll break it down into four quarters and provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "Here's a big point on homeschooling that no one has mentioned yet: Military families."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral; it introduces a positive but somewhat uncontroversial point.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker is introducing a viewpoint but does not assert dominance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.2 (Low intensity; it’s an introductory remark.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.2 (Abstract opening statement with no specifics yet.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "My dad was active duty military when I was growing up and as a result we moved 10 times before I turned 13."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; sharing a personal experience, but not emotionally charged.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The author has personal experience, giving them some authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Moderate; personal history reveals a challenge associated with military life.)

### Quarter 3:

- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Concrete example that illustrates the challenge faced.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "Many times these moves took place during the conventional school year, so homeschooling meant that we could keep up with our curriculum even though we we're moving to a different state while the normal school year was still in session."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive; focuses on a clear benefit of homeschooling regarding consistency.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument demonstrates a strong personal perspective, offering clarity and resolution.)
