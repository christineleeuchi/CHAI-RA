To assess the argument based on the requested dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—let's breakdown the passage into four quarters and rate each dimension accordingly:

**Quarter 1: "When inside lanes are turning right, the out-most lanes cannot see traffic."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (This has a slightly negative tone, highlighting a hazard.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The statement suggests a concern, hinting at a problem rather than asserting authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; it states an observable fact without strong emotion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument presents a specific scenario involving visibility of traffic.)

**Quarter 2: "That is a hazard..."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (This is clearly negative, identifying a risk or danger.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The assertion of hazard lends some authority, but it's still largely a concern.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The description of a hazard adds a sense of urgency.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The idea of a ‘hazard’ is tangible but somewhat abstract without further specifics.)

**Quarter 3: "...even if you're banking on 'well, if he's turning, I can just turn on the inside and it's safe...'"**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (This conveys a mix of skepticism and caution.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The speaker critiques a common belief, giving them a slight authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (There’s an everyday quality to the statement, though it includes a hint of warning.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The phrasing discusses a common driving behavior, making it relatable.)

**Quarter 4: "...except that people often shoot into a far lane knowing they don't have to get up to speed before someone in a closer lane would be catching/passing/colliding with them."**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (This is negative, as it describes risky behavior that can lead to accidents.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The statement implies knowledge about driver behavior, asserting a clearer understanding of the issue.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The language used ('shoot into a far lane') conveys urgency and danger.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very specific about driving behavior and its consequences.)

In summary, here are the ratings based on the analysis of each quarter:

**Quarter 1:**
- Valence: 0.6
- Dominance: 0.4
- Intensity: 0.5
- Concreteness: 0.7

**Quarter 2:**
- Valence: 0.3
- Dominance: 0.3
- Intensity: 0.6
- Concreteness: 0.5

**Quarter 3:**
- Valence: 0.5
- Dominance: 0.4
- Intensity: 0.4
- Concreteness: 0.6

**Quarter 4:**
- Valence: 0.2
- Dominance: 0.5
- Intensity: 0.7
- Concreteness: 0.8

Here's a rating for each of the four categories (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) for each quarter of the argument text:

### 1st Quarter:
**Text:** "Right on red", when it's allowed, is primarily because you're going from the innermost lane TO the intersecting innermost lane: there's only one lane of moving traffic to worry about (the one you're turning into).

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The argument has a mostly positive tone about right turns on red.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument is relatively neutral, presenting a factual observation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The explanation carries a considerate level of emphasis on safety.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The mention of specific lanes provides clear imagery.)

### 2nd Quarter:
**Text:** If there's an "outer right", then you have to turn into the 2nd lane of the intersecting road and that triples the number of lanes to be concerned about (two lanes on the intersecting road, PLUS the inner right).

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is still somewhat neutral but raises a concern about safety.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The argument is beginning to assert the complexity that outer rights introduce.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The use of "triples" adds emphasis to the potential danger.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (The detailed description of lanes makes it very concrete.)

### 3rd Quarter:
**Text:** And since I'm in your neck of the woods (I've spent way too much time waiting for that same damn light), consider this part, too: this part of the state is infamous for asshat drivers blocking people from turning, changing lanes, etc...

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone becomes more negative as it introduces frustrations with local drivers.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The statement adds a personal opinion that emphasizes local context.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The use of "asshat drivers" reflects high emotional intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it's personal, it lacks specific details about the driving conditions.)

### 4th Quarter:
**Text:** could you imagine the chaos? :D

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This portion has a humorous but chaotic tone, which suggests negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (It implies a personal perspective, slightly shifting the argument's weight.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (The rhetorical question adds a high level of emotional engagement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The use of "chaos" is abstract; it's not specific in the context of driving.)

These scores reflect the text's varying emotional and concrete aspects across its sections.
