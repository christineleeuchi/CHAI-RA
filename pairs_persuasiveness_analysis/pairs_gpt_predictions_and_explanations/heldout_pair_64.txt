Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Hereâ€™s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of each quarter of the provided argument:

### Quarter 1: "If the definition of 'cis' is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they just be called women and men?"
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone questions existing definitions and seems to express frustration, but it is not entirely negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts an opinion and challenges the status quo, indicating a desire for clarity.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument presents a moderate level of intensity; the frustration is present but not overwhelming.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is abstract regarding the idea of gender labels but specific in referencing "cis.")

### Quarter 2: "Because the terms 'woman' and 'man' got overloaded."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral statement acknowledging complexity, without strong positive or negative connotations.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts a point but does not particularly dominate the discourse.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low intensity; the statement is straightforward and factual.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific in describing the issue of overloaded terms.)

### Quarter 3: "The word 'woman' can refer to either a 'trans-woman' (a person who was male at birth but has reassigned to female) or a 'cis-woman' (a person who was and still is female)."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Informative and somewhat neutral but brings attention to a complexity that some may find problematic.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It states facts but does not push for a specific agenda; it's more explanatory.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity as it outlines the distinctions in gender identity, clarifying context.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Highly concrete, as it defines specific terms clearly.)

### Quarter 4: "You can be annoyed about it, but 'cis' definitely has a meaning."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Mixed; acknowledges annoyance but reinforces that "cis" holds significance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts the importance of the term "cis," pushing back against potential dismissal.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; a rebuttal indicating that there's substance despite annoyance.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat concrete in its assertion of meaning but less specific in examples than previous sections.)

Overall, the argument reflects a blend of clarification, assertion of terminology, and recognition of the complexities in gender language.
