Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To assign ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument, I'll break down my assessment as follows:

### Quarter 1: "These are good rules of thumb for 'civil behaviour' i.e. an etiquette, a how-to-act when in society, but they are not at the core of morality..."

- **Valence: 0.5** - The tone is neutral, acknowledging the utility of the rules while simultaneously critiquing their depth. 
- **Dominance: 0.4** - The argument asserts a viewpoint against the rules but does not strongly dominate the narrative; it addresses them respectfully rather than aggressively. 
- **Intensity: 0.4** - The intensity is moderate; it does not convey a strong emotional appeal, but there is a clear conviction in the argument.
- **Concreteness: 0.6** - The language used is fairly clear and specific regarding the distinction of the rules as etiquette rather than core morality.

### Quarter 2: "How we treat each other is a secondary concern/consequence - how we treat ourselves is primary..."

- **Valence: 0.6** - The sentiment appears more positive when emphasizing self-treatment as a primary concern without a negative evaluation of interpersonal treatment.
- **Dominance: 0.5** - A stronger stance is taken here, asserting that self-treatment is fundamental to morality, suggesting a position of influence.
- **Intensity: 0.5** - The declaration of self-treatment as "primary" shows a moderate intensity of belief in its importance.
- **Concreteness: 0.7** - The argument is presented clearly and with some detail, making it easy to understand the core message.

### Quarter 3: "The core of morality is that the individual has the capacity to choose..."

- **Valence: 0.7** - The framing of individual choice as central to morality gives this part a more uplifting sentiment.
- **Dominance: 0.6** - This portion commands more authority in the argument, clearly stating what constitutes the core of morality.
- **Intensity: 0.7** - There's a strong assertion of values here, indicating a high intensity as it presents a foundational aspect of morality.
- **Concreteness: 0.8** - The argument is well-defined and structured, effectively capturing the essence of morality with clear examples.

### Quarter 4: "There are thousands of virtues (and vices) that have nothing to do with others..."

- **Valence: 0.6** - This part maintains a positive outlook toward virtues, highlighting the importance of personal development.
- **Dominance: 0.5** - While asserting the value of self-virtues, it does not completely overshadow the previous points, allowing for a balanced perspective.
- **Intensity: 0.6** - The list of virtues provides a sense of strength and energy, though it maintains a rational tone.
- **Concreteness: 0.9** - The mention of specific virtues and examples adds substantial clarity and detail to the argument, making it very concrete.

### Summary Ratings:
- **Quarter 1: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.6**

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To rate the argument presented in each of the four categories—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—I'll break down the argument into four quarters and assess each according to your specifications.

### Quarter 1: "The Golden rule is obviously deeply flawed, because people want very different things."
- **Valence:** 0.2 - This statement has a negative tone towards the Golden Rule, expressing a disagreement or opposition.
- **Dominance:** 0.4 - The phrasing suggests a strong assertion of the author's position, but the word "obviously" can alienate those who might not agree.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The intensity is moderate; it emphasizes a significant flaw but doesn’t convey extreme passion or urgency.
- **Concreteness:** 0.3 - The argument is somewhat abstract, as it does not provide specific examples of the "very different things" people want.

### Quarter 2: "Uncertainty. It is often hard to know what others want."
- **Valence:** 0.1 - This part maintains a negative valence toward the Platinum Rule due to its inherent challenges.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The statement stands confidently, presenting a clear limitation to the idea of the Platinum Rule.
- **Intensity:** 0.4 - The discussion of uncertainty adds some intensity, but it remains somewhat neutral in expression.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - The argument about uncertainty has a degree of concreteness; it addresses a real challenge but lacks specific scenarios.

### Quarter 3: "What a person wants may require you doing an immoral act."
- **Valence:** 0.1 - This is a negatively valenced statement that critiques the Platinum Rule's implications with a serious ethical concern.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The assertion is strong; it addresses a significant ethical dilemma directly tied to the intention behind the Platinum Rule.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 - The seriousness of discussing immoral acts gives this part a high intensity and urgency.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - This quarter is relatively concrete, using the example of a heroin addict to illustrate the immorality of certain desires.

### Quarter 4: "Conflict. Often the wants of one person may be in conflict with another."
- **Valence:** 0.2 - The tone suggests a negative aspect of the Platinum Rule by highlighting an ethical conflict.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - This part asserts dominance by addressing a fundamental challenge in ethical decision-making.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - The conflict between desires adds a heightened sense of urgency to the argument, pointing to moral complexities.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The mention of conflicting wants provides a concrete illustration, but lacks further elaboration or examples.

### Summary
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.3
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.1, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.1, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.6

These scores reflect the effectiveness and depth of each part of your argument in addressing the flaws of the Golden and Platinum Rules in a moral context.
