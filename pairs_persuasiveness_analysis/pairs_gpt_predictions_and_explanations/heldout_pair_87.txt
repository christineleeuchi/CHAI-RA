Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide ratings for the specified dimensions of the argument, I will evaluate each quarter of the text based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. Here are the ratings out of 1.0:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "I think that watching these videos would have a much greater impact on people and make them more likely to do something to help. Personally, if I watch videos like this I feel sick and it disturbs me for about half a week. I cannot forget about them easily. Just reading about these events does not have this effect and I can forget about the issues relatively quickly."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The sentiment is mixed; there's a positive view on watching videos for impact, but also negative feelings about the disturbing nature of the content.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The argument presents a clear standpoint advocating for a specific action, reflecting a strong sense of agency.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The speaker expresses strong emotional reactions, indicating significant intensity regarding the subject.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument includes specific references to the effects of watching videos versus reading, though it lacks detailed examples of the actions taken.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "Having watched them, what have you done to help that you would not otherwise have done? Also, what more do you think can be done that is not already being done?"
- **Valence:** 0.5 (The questions indicate an exploration of pro-social behavior and possibilities for action, which can elicit a neutral to positive sentiment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (There is a challenge to the audience about their actions, which gives the speaker a degree of dominance in directing the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; without personal anecdotes or emotional appeal in this segment, it feels lower.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The request for specific actions adds a level of concreteness, encouraging reflection on tangible outcomes.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "Wars on such groups aren't like wars on countries. You can't just hit them and call it a day. It's a war on extremism, ideologies, and perversions of cultures."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment is largely negative, framing the situation as complex and grave, which may evoke concern.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (While the speaker provides a perspective on the complexity of the issue, it doesn't assert dominance over the discourse as strongly.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The language conveys a sense of urgency and seriousness, though it lacks personal emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (This part of the argument provides clear distinctions and definitions regarding the nature of the conflict, enhancing understanding.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "There is no specific ethnic group you can reasonably target (since these things span many such groups but encompass none of them entirely), no region you can unreservedly attack."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The statement reflects a problematic situation without a clearer path forward, which may induce frustration or despair.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (This segment presents more of an analytical viewpoint than an assertive one; it's descriptive rather than commanding.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The level of intensity is moderate, as it articulates the challenges but does not evoke a strong emotional response.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (The clarity of the argument is high, as it outlines the complexities of targeting specific groups versus broader ideologies.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.9

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the provided argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text, I would assign the following scores:

1. **First Quarter: "Just reading about these events does not have this effect and I can forget about the issues relatively quickly."**
   - **Valence:** 0.2 (negative, as it reflects a sense of detachment or sadness regarding the inability to engage deeply)
   - **Dominance:** 0.3 (low, as there is a sense of passivity in the experience of forgetting)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (moderate, indicating some feeling of frustration but not overwhelming)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (somewhat abstract, since it refers to feelings rather than specific experiences)

2. **Second Quarter: "My small anecdotal contribution: When I read of the executions of James Foley, Stephen Sotloff, etc. and what ISIS was doing to the local people of the areas they controlled..."**
   - **Valence:** 0.1 (very negative, as it discusses brutal events)
   - **Dominance:** 0.4 (moderate, as the mention of specific individuals and events lends some weight to the argument)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (high intensity due to the psychological impact of such traumatic content)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (fairly concrete due to the mention of specific individuals and situations)

3. **Third Quarter: "...I had multiple nightmares."**
   - **Valence:** 0.1 (very negative, as it indicates distress from the experience)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (moderate, as nightmares illustrate a significant personal impact)
   - **Intensity:** 0.7 (high intensity, as nightmares indicate a deep psychological reaction)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (very concrete, as it provides a specific experience)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "Even stumbling upon pictures from right before an execution scared me and it was difficult to get the image out of my head."**
   - **Valence:** 0.0 (extremely negative, reflecting extreme discomfort and fear)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (moderate to high, as the experience of fear is strong and impactful)
   - **Intensity:** 0.8 (very intense, indicating a strong emotional and psychological response)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.8 (highly concrete, as it describes a specific reaction to specific images)

These scores reflect the emotional and psychological weight of the statements made in each quarter of the argument.
