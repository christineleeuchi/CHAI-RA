Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument using the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break down each quarter of the text and assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 for each criterion.

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "What's your definition of 'societal cohesion'? If you define the term such that 'less crime' = 'more cohesion', then sure. But I don't think anyone disagrees with such an obvious point; we all agree that men commit more crime."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (The text has a moderately positive and neutral tone but challenges the existing argument.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is asserting control over the definition of "societal cohesion," which indicates a level of dominance in the conversation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The intensity is moderate; the speaker is questioning rather than passionately arguing.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The argument revolves around clear definitions of terms, making it concrete.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "If you define it in any way that doesn't make your view painfully obvious, then I'm not so sure. Basically what you're saying is 'any group with an above average crime rate is detrimental to social cohesion'."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative, as it questions the argument's validity without strong emotional charge.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly asserts that the definition needs to be reconsidered, displaying a degree of authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The challenge to the argument indicates a higher intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This part remains quite specific about the logic being criticized, providing a concrete example of the argument's implications.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "Well, that would imply the populous of California and Texas are all detrimental to social cohesion, since they have above average crime rates. However, I doubt anyone would agree with such a notion, unless you define social cohesion in a weird way."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is inquisitive but subtly ridiculing the original argument, leaning slightly toward a negative valence.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The comparison to California and Texas asserts a strong point against the original argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Emphasizes the absurdity of the original claim, increasing intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Uses specific examples to illustrate a point, enhancing concreteness.)

### Quarter 4:
**Text:** "I mean, let's think about the logic you're using and apply it to other groups. People aged 18-65 also have an above average crime rate when compared to the general population. Does that mean people of this age are detrimental to social cohesion? Again, probably not, unless you define 'social cohesion' very strangely."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly critical tone, does not evoke strong sentiment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Maintains authority by questioning the argument's logic and reasoning.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The application of logic to another group increases the argument's intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete in its use of age as a comparison but slightly less clear than previous quarters.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7

These scores can provide a nuanced understanding of the different dimensions of the argument presented.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Hereâ€™s a rating for each dimension of the argument, broken down into quarters:

1. **Valence (0.5)**: The argument takes a neutral stance on crime and social cohesion as it highlights both the flaw in reasoning and acknowledges that most individuals, regardless of hair color, are not involved in crime. However, it does suggest a potential issue with the reasoning, which could slightly tilt the valence toward a critical perspective.

2. **Dominance (0.4)**: The argument attempts to challenge a potentially flawed assumption about crime in relation to a specific subgroup (brunettes), indicating a level of assertiveness. However, it also recognizes the broader context, which somewhat mitigates its dominance.

3. **Intensity (0.3)**: The intensity is moderate, as the argument makes a point but does so in a fairly calm and analytical manner. It does not express strong emotions or urgency, leading to a lower intensity score.

4. **Concreteness (0.6)**: The argument is somewhat concrete as it discusses specific groups (brunettes in this case) and connects them to crime statistics. It presents a clear example, making it more concrete than abstract, though the overall idea remains a hypothetical scenario. 

Overall, the argument presents a nuanced perspective while recognizing the limitations of applying minority behaviors to the majority, resulting in a balanced set of scores across the dimensions.
