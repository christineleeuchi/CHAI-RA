Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument based on the criteria provided (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), let's break down the argument into four quarters. I will provide a score for each criterion ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

**Quarter 1: "I think it's more like"**
- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; expressing a personal perspective)
- **Dominance**: 0.2 (Low dominance; suggests a hesitant opinion)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Mildly intense; suggests contemplation)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Some concrete ideas but largely abstract)

**Quarter 2: "I have this very strong opinion and I'm really in the mood for arguing about it"**
- **Valence**: 0.6 (Positive; strong conviction expressed)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Moderate dominance; indicates a desire to engage in argument)
- **Intensity**: 0.9 (High intensity; communicates strong feelings about the opinion)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Somewhat concrete; stating the desire for argument but still abstract)

**Quarter 3: "but I don't particularly want to change it"**
- **Valence**: 0.4 (Slightly negative; indicates resistance to change)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Moderate dominance; assertion of personal stance)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate intensity; less emphatic than previous parts)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (More concrete; clearly states the desire not to change)

**Quarter 4: "so I'm just gonna ignore the excellent counterarguments that took ages to write and not give people the deltas they deserve."**
- **Valence**: 0.2 (Negative; reflects dismissiveness toward others' efforts)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Moderate dominance; asserting disregard for counterarguments)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (High intensity; communicates strong disregard)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Quite concrete; explicitly mentions counterarguments and the idea of not reciprocating)

Overall, these scores reflect the emotional and rhetorical aspects of the argument while considering the phrasing and implications of each part.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide a rating score for each category (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness) based on the argument outlined, I will evaluate each quarter of the argument separately.

### Quarter 1:
**Argument:** "If a point of view is supported by group think, it does not mean the point of view is wrong, it just means many people use a flawed method to get there. It might be wrong, but we wouldn't know until we examine the argument itself."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive outlook on examining viewpoints)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Neutral tone; not overly assertive)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in the argument)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Some abstract concepts about group think)

### Quarter 2:
**Argument:** "The important point therefore is not whether the people arguing here are arguing for a point that is also supported by group think amongst others, but rather what process we use to convince people."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Generally positive, focusing on processes)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (More assertive about the importance of process)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; clear assertion of importance)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Still somewhat abstract, but clearer about the focus)

### Quarter 3:
**Argument:** "If a controversial point does not stand a test of logic or evidence, then the change of view has nothing to do with learning how to group think."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Clear focus on logic/evidence is a positive stance)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Stronger statement about logic and standards)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Higher intensity when discussing tests of logic)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete as it references logic and evidence)

### Quarter 4:
**Argument:** "for each quarter of the argument's text"

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This part is less meaningful)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Lacks assertiveness or relevance)
- **Intensity:** 0.2 (Very low intensity)
- **Concreteness:** 0.1 (Very abstract and vague)

### Summary:
- **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.3, Intensity: 0.2, Concreteness: 0.1
