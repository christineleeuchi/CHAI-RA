Sure! Here’s a rating score for each quarter of the argument based on the metrics you've provided: valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1: "I believe that what you are referring to is called Soft Power (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power). You can oppose it to hard power where a country spreads its influence through economic or military power."

- **Valence**: 0.7 (Neutral-to-positive; introduces a concept without strong emotional weight)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Positions the speaker as knowledgeable, but acknowledges different types of power)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (Fairly low; mostly informative and foundational)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Provides clear definitions of soft and hard power)

### Quarter 2: "The US and Europe have historically used both: soft power is the cultural influence you're referring to and hard power would be colonialism (amongst other methods)."

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; describes historical facts without strong positive or negative connotations)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Retains an academic tone; remains factual)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate; discusses significant historical events)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Provides tangible examples of the concepts)

### Quarter 3: "China has hard power: The US is highly dependent on their economy and they can dictate terms in many industries (lobbying as you mentioned)."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (Slightly positive; points out the strength of China’s hard power)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (Asserts a strong position about China's influence)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity; making a claim about economic dependence)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Generalizes about economic dependence without specific examples)

### Quarter 4: "My point is that perhaps as a westerner, you won't be appealed by their lifestyle now, but further down the road, other generations might be. Your example of African nouveau rich is my counter argument: First, Europeans colonized Africa with hard power, and many generations later, Africans have started to be influenced by Europeans' soft power (cars and cigars). Who knows? You don’t feel any relation to Chinese culture right now but perhaps your grandkids will!"

- **Valence**: 0.5 (Explorative and speculative; neutral in tone)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (Challenging the initial argument; promotes an alternative perspective)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (More intense due to the speculative nature; expressing a vision for the future)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Uses historical reference points but remains hypothetical about future influence)

Here’s a breakdown of the argument you provided, rated on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for each category:

### Valence
- **Rating: 0.4** 
  - The argument has a neutral to slightly negative tone towards China's potential for cultural influence compared to the US. It acknowledges China's hard power but views its soft power unfavorably, suggesting a lack of respect for its cultural impact.

### Dominance
- **Rating: 0.6**
  - The argument positions the US as the dominant cultural force and portrays China as unlikely to compete in this arena. While it acknowledges the significance of hard power, the implication that China will never achieve the same cultural influence reflects a clear hierarchy.

### Intensity
- **Rating: 0.5**
  - The intensity is moderate. The argument makes strong claims about the hierarchy of influence between hard and soft power and establishes the US as superior culturally. However, the language is not overly aggressive or bellicose, keeping it somewhat measured.

### Concreteness
- **Rating: 0.7**
  - The argument is relatively concrete in that it outlines specific ideas (hard vs. soft power) and contrasts the cultural influences of the US, China, and the USSR. It uses straightforward comparisons and references to make its points, although some terms like "ape your ways" may introduce generalization.

Overall, the argument's tone and structure point to a clear perspective regarding the state of cultural influence, with an emphasis on measurable impact (hard vs. soft power) that manifests itself in specific examples or comparisons.
