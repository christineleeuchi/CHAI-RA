Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the requested dimensions—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—let’s break down the argument into its quarters and analyze each one:

### Quarter 1
**Text**: "In my mind, a lot of the problem comes from that a lot of people's ideas about virginity and purity and 'sluttiness' aren't based in reality."
- **Valence**: 0.3 (The statement presents a critical view of societal beliefs, capturing a sense of negativity toward the misunderstanding of these concepts.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker asserts their opinion but doesn't exhibit strong authority over the subject yet.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The argument has a moderately strong intensity as it challenges societal views.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (It's somewhat abstract, discussing concepts rather than providing specific examples.)

### Quarter 2
**Text**: "The idea that if a woman has had multiple partners she's 'unclean' or has poor morals is just a stereotype."
- **Valence**: 0.7 (This statement has a strong negative valence as it directly opposes derogatory stereotypes.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker takes a clearer stance, presenting a stronger authority against the stereotype.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The argument intensifies as it emphasizes the absurdity of the stereotype.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (References to concepts of 'unclean' or 'poor morals' are still somewhat conceptual but clearer.)

### Quarter 3
**Text**: "If you aren't attracted to someone for whatever reason, that's fine - but if you are just basing decisions off of stereotypes of what being a 'slut' means, then I think it's absolutely fair for people to challenge those beliefs."
- **Valence**: 0.6 (This portion acknowledges personal attraction while criticizing stereotype-based decisions, balancing between neutral and negative views.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The speaker asserts their right to challenge beliefs, showing a stronger position.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The argument gains intensity as it invites others to question their beliefs.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (It provides more concrete terms like "challenge those beliefs," suggesting an active stance against stereotypes.)

### Quarter 4
**Text**: This quarter encapsulates the overall argument without an explicit additional text.
- **Valence**: 0.6 (The overall sentiment remains critical of stereotypes, maintaining a negative valence.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (The speaker’s authority grows as they assert the fairness of questioning beliefs.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The argument is strongly resonant and encourages self-reflection regarding stereotypes.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (It remains somewhat abstract but ties together the previous points effectively.)

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Sure! Here's a rating score for each dimension based on the provided argument, broken down by quarters of the text:

**1st Quarter: "I agree that you don't have to date anyone you don't want to."**
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive acknowledgment of personal choice in dating)
- **Dominance:** 0.2 (Submissive tone; the speaker is not asserting superiority)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; a straightforward statement)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (A clear, concrete assertion about personal preferences)

**2nd Quarter: "The problem is, you don't usually criticize people for not adhering to your preferences. 'I am not attracted to tall girls' is fine, 'ew, girls should never be tall!' Is not."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Evaluative stance that contrasts acceptable and unacceptable expressions)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Some assertiveness in expressing a norm but not overly dominant)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Stronger intensity, particularly in critiquing the negative attitude)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear examples provided to illustrate the argument)

**3rd Quarter: "'Slut' is a word with that kind of judgment/criticism built in, and when people are called out for acknowledging a woman's promiscuity, it is usually because they are being critical."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative; addressing the judgmental aspect of language)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced perspective, stating a viewpoint without being overly aggressive)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Some intensity in the critique of language use)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Concrete assertion about the implications of the term "slut")

**4th Quarter: "I would be hesitant to date a girl who has been with over 20 guys because I would worry about her ability to commit. Likewise, I'd have reservations about dating a girl who is a virgin at 25. But I would never criticize or call her names like 'slut.'"**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Mixed feelings; personal reservations presented without derogatory language)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Expresses personal views while acknowledging they don't entail judgment)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Stronger intensity in expressing personal feelings about commitment)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Specific examples that illustrate hesitations concretely)
