To rate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we'll break it down into four quarters and analyze each segment. Here's how I would rate each aspect:

### Quarter 1: "You're still really young. I've known plenty of people who really didn't start dating until their 20's--including short guys."
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive; offers reassurance and examples of others in similar situations)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Slightly dominant; encouraging, but doesn't assert authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; a gentle reminder that youth is on his side)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Fairly concrete; references known persons as examples)

### Quarter 2: "I have plenty of short friends who make piss poor money (most of them are school teachers) who still found love."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Generally positive; highlights that financial status or height do not determine love)

- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete; uses specific examples of friends)

### Quarter 3: "Hell, I have short, fat friends who don't make much to any money who didn't start dating until much later in life who still found someone they fell in love with and happily married."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive; reinforces the message that love can be found later in life despite obstacles)

- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete; more specific examples provided)

### Quarter 4: "The only thing that would guarantee you to stay alone is if you continue with the attitude that you're somehow meant to be alone. Be happy, enjoy life, and take some ladies out."
- **Valence:** 0.9 (Highly positive; motivational advice aimed at changing mindset)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderately dominant; encourages action and change in thinking)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Strong; calls for an emotional shift and proactive behavior)
