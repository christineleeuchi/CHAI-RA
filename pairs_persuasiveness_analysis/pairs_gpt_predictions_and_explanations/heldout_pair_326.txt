Here is the rating for each of the specified characteristics of the argument provided:

1. **Valence**: 0.6  
   The argument leans slightly negative, as it highlights potential downsides of having a tattoo. However, it acknowledges that most employers are indifferent, which tempers the negativity somewhat.

2. **Dominance**: 0.4  
   The argument presents a personal perspective indicating that there are situations where a tattoo might negatively affect job opportunities. While it's a valid point, it doesn't assert a strong authority over the topic; it reflects personal experiences instead.

3. **Intensity**: 0.5  
   The argument expresses a moderate intensity. It brings up specific scenarios that can potentially impact employment chances but does not strongly emphasize urgency or a dramatic consequence.

4. **Concreteness**: 0.7  
   This argument uses concrete examples (meeting potential employers at a baseball game, encounters during outdoor activities) to support its claims, making it relatable and tangible. However, it could have further included specific instances of tattoos affecting employment. 

Overall, while the argument does present valid concerns, it balances them with the idea that many employers are not overly concerned with tattoosâ€”especially if they are not offensive.
