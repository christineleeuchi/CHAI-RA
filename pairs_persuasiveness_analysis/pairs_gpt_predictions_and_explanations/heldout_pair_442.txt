### 1st Quarter (Pros for oranges)
- **Valence:** 0.8 (The argument has a positive tone about oranges and highlights their practical advantages.)

- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The speaker expresses strong personal feelings about convenience and cleanliness, particularly against apples.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The points about practicality and cleanliness are specific and easy to visualize.)

### 2nd Quarter (Refutation of Alcohol point)
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is somewhat negative towards apples, but it's more about challenging a point rather than being overtly dismissive.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts their view and questions the inherent advantages of apples.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (This part is less emotionally charged than the previous quarter; it’s more of a factual assertion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (While referring to an interesting cultural practice, it’s less concrete than the previous examples but still tangible.)

### 3rd Quarter (Refutation of Food and Diversity)
- **Valence:** 0.5 (This section is neutral to slightly negative; it addresses oranges rather than promoting them.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker acknowledges the possibility of orange pie but does not assert strong dominance over the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (This part lacks the same emotional intensity of personal preference and is focused on practical arguments.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The mention of other citrus fruits adds some specificity, but it’s more abstract than the earlier points.)

### 4th Quarter (Refutation of Pop culture)
- **Valence:** 0.5 (This is more analytical and somewhat neutral, assessing factors behind apple's symbolic success without strong praise for oranges.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a perspective on branding but seems to concede that apples had certain advantages.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (This part is less emotionally engaging and more focused on theory and language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The discussion about naming impacts does offer tangible ideas, though its abstract nature may weaken concreteness.)

In summary:
- The first quarter is the strongest in terms of positivity and personal connection, followed by a steady decline through the next sections that become more analytical and less emotionally charged.
