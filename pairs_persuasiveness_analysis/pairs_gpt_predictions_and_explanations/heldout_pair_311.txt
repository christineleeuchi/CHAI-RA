- **Concreteness: 0.4** - While there is an attempt to quantify preferences in percentages, there is still an absence of substantial evidence.

### 4th Quarter (Final points about genetic profiles)
- **Valence: 0.3** - The comment maintains a critical stance toward both bisexuality and heterosexuality, generating a negative overall perspective.
- **Dominance: 0.9** - The author takes an authoritative tone advocating for genetic changes, pushing the argument forcefully.
