Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To assess the argument in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, hereâ€™s a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the argument's text:

**1st Quarter: "Why can't a private business make the same decision?"**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as this is a question that could lead to either positive or negative opinions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The question suggests a level of inquiry but does not assert a strong position.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (The phrasing is mild and straightforward.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The question is specific but does not provide tangible examples at this stage.)

**2nd Quarter: "Because, when we talk about businesses, we're usually talking about conglomerates that have formally incorporated in one way or the other."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; providing a definition without emotional appeal.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (This statement begins to assert a position regarding the nature of businesses.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Mild statement of fact.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (This introduces concrete terminology about business structures.)

**3rd Quarter: "Incorporation is a creature of statute; it's created by the government."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; simply stating a fact.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (More dominant as it explains the basis of incorporation.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity as it clarifies an important legal concept.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Specific and clear, relating to legal definitions.)

**4th Quarter: "It's more reasonable for the government to attach strings on the benefits associated with incorporation than it is to you as an individual..."**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive towards government regulation and oversight.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly asserts a viewpoint regarding government authority over businesses.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Expresses a convincing rationale.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Fairly concrete, discussing the practical implications of government policies.)

To evaluate the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, we can break it into four segments and score each aspect as follows:

**Segment 1: "A private business is not a private citizen."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral assertion; states a fact without positive or negative connotation).
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Makes a claim that sets the stage for a larger argument but does not dominate).
- **Intensity:** 0.2 (Low intensity; straightforward statement).
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete distinction between business and citizen).

**Segment 2: "You are getting all sorts of sanctioned protections and services from the government. Protections like firefighters and police, and services like roads, distribution channels, domestic protection, etc etc."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive connotation about the benefits of government services).
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Significantly supports the main argument).
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; lists several important services).
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete examples of services).

**Segment 3: "All of these services mean that you have to enter into a general contract with the federal, state, and local governments. Part of this contract is an agreement to provide equal services to all citizens."**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Generally positive view on equality).
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Strongly supports the central argument about obligations).
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in stating obligations of businesses).
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Some abstract concepts, but uses "contract" which is concrete).

**Segment 4: "A business can't get all the benefits of doing business in America and then just be an asshole to certain groups for no reason. If they really want a totally 'Free' market, they can open up in Somalia and provide all their own services, and then discriminate against whichever customers they want."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative connotation in the term "asshole" and the context of discrimination).
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong conclusion that wraps up the argument).
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity; passionate language).
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (A mix of abstract concepts with an illustrative example).

Overall, this is a more nuanced evaluation, reflecting that each segment contributes differently to the overall argument.
