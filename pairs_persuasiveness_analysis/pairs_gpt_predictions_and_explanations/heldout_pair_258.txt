Let's break down the argument into four quarters and provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each section.

### Quarter 1: "The reason for this is because you fail to factor in China. China was ballsy enough to invade an independent Vietnam that was allied with the USSR after the war. You would be crazy to think that they would allow a territory close to their South to fall to another enemy."

- **Valence**: 0.6 (The argument presents a somewhat negative view of potential Chinese aggression but emphasizes the strategic necessity of considering China.)
- **Dominance**: 0.8 (This section confidently asserts the viewpoint that understanding China's role is crucial.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (The language is somewhat strong, calling the reader "crazy" for not considering the implications of China's actions.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (While it references the historical context, it's a bit vague regarding specific consequences or evidence.)

### Quarter 2: "If the South started winning and legitimately invaded the North, China would most likely allow North Vietnam's leadership to die off and they would install their own leaders and probably destroy the South."

- **Valence**: 0.4 (This scenario presents a negative outcome, indicating that it would lead to further destruction.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (The assertion is quite strong, positing what China would definitely do.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The language generates concern and fear regarding Chinese actions, making a definitive statement.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (This section is moderately concrete, providing specific outcomes regarding leadership changes.)

### Quarter 3: "And in the impossible scenario where the South wins with No Chinese/Soviet intervention then Vietnam would be the same/worse. It was horribly corrupt under the South leadership..."

- **Valence**: 0.3 (This part of the argument is heavily negative, discussing corruption and a bleak outlook for a Southern victory.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Although there's a strong opinion, it argues against the Southern leadership without actively asserting a new dominant position.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (There's a high intensity in the critique of Southern governance and potential future conflicts.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (Despite the discussion of corruption and potential outcomes, it lacks specific historical grounding or detailed scenarios.)

### Quarter 4: "The last scenario is the US intervenes..."

- **Valence**: 0.2 (The scenario discusses significant negative outcomes for the U.S. and Vietnam, leading to a pessimistic view.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (This section outlines a strong potential viewpoint on the outcome of U.S. intervention but is less assertive than previous sections.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The language conveys urgency and high stakes, especially regarding the potential for nuclear war and loss of lives.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (It presents specific scenarios but relies on generalized terms and speculative outcomes regarding the geopolitical situation.)

Here’s a rating for each of the categories—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—based on the provided argument. Each of these categories is rated on a scale from 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high):

1. **Valence**: 0.8  
   The argument expresses a positive sentiment towards the Vietnamese people and their history, highlighting their resilience and achievements. Although it recognizes the complexities of their past and the implications of foreign influence, the overall tone remains respectful and admiring.

2. **Dominance**: 0.6

3. **Intensity**: 0.7  
   The argument carries a degree of emotional weight, particularly in its admiration for the Vietnamese people and their struggles against colonial and imperial forces. The mention of mass atrocities and the use of direct quotations contributes to a higher intensity, reflecting the seriousness of the historical context.

4. **Concreteness**: 0.5
