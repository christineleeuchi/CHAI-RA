Let's break down the argument into its four quarters and provide the requested ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

### Quarter 1: "everyone is entitled to human companionship"
- **Valence:** 0.8 (The statement has a positive connotation, advocating for companionship.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The claim invokes a sense of moral authority but is balanced by questions regarding entitlement.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (It's a reasonably strong assertion but tempered by the need for justification.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The idea of companionship is somewhat abstract but relatable.)

### Quarter 2: "by what laws of nature are people *entitled* to it?"
- **Valence:** 0.2 (The question challenges the positive assertion made earlier, introducing a negative undertone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The rhetorical question implies a stronger argumentative stance, questioning the entitlement.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (This section conveys strong skepticism about the original claim.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The questioning of "laws of nature" makes it somewhat abstract but grounded in societal norms.)

### Quarter 3: "Single guys suffering deserve as much respect and empathy as women who may face different challenges"
- **Valence:** 0.7 (This portion remains affirming and empathetic, promoting respect for single men.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (While supportive, it does not impose strong authority, as the statement is more about equality.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The statement is supportive but lacks strong emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Relatable and grounded in a social context.)

### Quarter 4: "Even if the other party isn't interested, it's brave of them... mocked for their courage"
- **Valence:** 0.5 (The perspective shifts to a nuanced view of bravery and cowardice, maintaining a mixed tone.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The assertion of bravery and the subsequent criticism reflect a degree of authority in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (There's a strong emotional element in the description of vulnerability and critique of methods.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The mention of specific interpersonal dynamics gives it a fairly tangible context.)
