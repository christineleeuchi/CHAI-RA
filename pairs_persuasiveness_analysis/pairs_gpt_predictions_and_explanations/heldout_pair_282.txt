Let's break down the argument into four quarters and provide ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each:

### Quarter 1:
*Argument:* "If the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it." 

- **Valence:** 0.7 (This expresses a positive sentiment towards the idea of data being used for governance.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker is expressing an opinion but also acknowledges uncertainty, making it neutral regarding their authority on the topic.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The belief is strong but contingent on conditions being met.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The idea is somewhat abstract, as it depends on the effectiveness of governance which is not defined here.)

### Quarter 2:
*Argument:* "If one could be certain that this is solely how the data would be used, then yes, I'd be in favor it it too, but that isn't how power works."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (This introduces doubt and a cautious stance towards the previous positive sentiment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts their understanding of power dynamics, establishing some authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The tone is more intense in skepticism about the nature of power.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (There is some abstraction in discussing how power works.)

### Quarter 3:
*Argument:* "It is also arguably illegal. So even if we wanted to do this, we'd potentially have to amend the constitution to grant the government this power."

- **Valence:** 0.2 (This introduces negative sentiment regarding legality and governmental power.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker is asserting a strong understanding of legal implications.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The argument about legality and constitutional amendments carries a strong emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The reference to the constitution adds a degree of specificity, making it somewhat concrete.)

### Quarter 4:
*Argument:* "Aside from abuse, there's also the fact that these data storage systems cannot be secured…This is very specifically the job of the Census folks, not the NSA."

- **Valence:** 0.1 (This is very negative, emphasizing distrust in security and government workings.)
- **Dominance:** 0.8 (The speaker is confident in their critique of both security and governance roles.)
- **Intensity:** 0.9 (The level of concern and criticism is high; the argument is very intense.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (References to specific examples, such as the Census and data breaches, provide concrete instances.)

Overall, the argument progresses from a potential positive viewpoint toward a strong critique of the government's use of collected data, illustrating concerns about legitimacy, power dynamics, and security.
