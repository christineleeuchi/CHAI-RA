Sure, here’s a rating for each aspect you mentioned throughout the argument:

1. **Valence**: This measures the emotional value or attractiveness of the argument.  
   - **Score**: 0.8  
   - **Reasoning**: The argument evokes feelings of loss and outrage over a cultural icon, which can resonate strongly with readers. It implies a sense of injustice that can be emotionally charged, thus having a high positive valence.

2. **Dominance**: This reflects the degree of influence or control presented in the argument.  
   - **Score**: 0.7  
   - **Reasoning**: The argument positions Cecil’s status as a cultural symbol against generic animal cruelty, giving it strong persuasive power. It asserts dominance by comparing it to a significant American landmark, which amplifies its argumentative weight.

3. **Intensity**: This refers to the strength or force of the emotions involved in the argument.  
   - **Score**: 0.9  
   - **Reasoning**: The comparison to the Washington monument and the idea of a well-known figure being 'blown up' invokes strong, intense feelings of shock and loss, thus, it has a high intensity.

4. **Concreteness**: This measures how easily the argument can be understood and related to tangible concepts.  
   - **Score**: 0.6  
   - **Reasoning**: While the argument uses a concrete analogy (the Washington monument), some might find the comparison a bit abstract, particularly if they don't share the same cultural context regarding Cecil. It may not be as relatable to everyone, resulting in a slightly lower score.

Here’s a summary of the scores:
- **Valence**: 0.8
- **Dominance**: 0.7
- **Intensity**: 0.9
- **Concreteness**: 0.6

   - **Dominance**: 0.6 (Moderate control, asserting a moral viewpoint)

   - **Valence**: 0.2 (Negative tone criticizing entitlement)
   - **Dominance**: 0.7 (Strong stance, asserting moral superiority)
   - **Intensity**: 0.8 (Highly emotional and forceful language)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Clear, but broad terms like "well-being" could be more specific)

3. **"Palmer broke the law."**
   - **Valence**: 0.2 (Neutral to slightly negative; emphasizes wrongdoing)
   - **Dominance**: 0.9 (High control, as it declares a legal violation)

   - **Concreteness**: 0.8 (Specific, straightforward legal claim)

   - **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral, privileges popularity of Cecil)
   - **Dominance**: 0.4 (Less assertive, stating a fact rather than making a moral claim)
   - **Intensity**: 0.6 (Moderate intensity; speaks to uniqueness)
