Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To provide ratings for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, here's the breakdown:

### First Quarter: 
_"Spirited Away_ contains one of the most hauntingly beautiful scenes I've ever encountered in a movie, one that resonates deeply with me."
- **Valence**: 0.8 (The language is positive, indicating a strong emotional response.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The statement expresses a personal feeling rather than asserting power or control over a subject.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Words like "hauntingly beautiful" and "resonates deeply" indicate a strong emotional reaction.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (While the scene is described as beautiful, it is still somewhat abstract without specific details about the scene itself.)

### Second Quarter: 
_I once spent six months of my life travelling, alone, in countries where I was either marginally fluent, barely able to speak a few hundred words, or completely incapable of communicating in the local language (depending on the country)._
- **Valence**: 0.3 (The experience of traveling alone suggests a mix of positive and negative; it has a slight negative tilt due to loneliness.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Describes a personal experience, but does not assert dominance.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (The experience of being "alone" and "incapable of communicating" conveys a considerable emotional weight.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (It's a specific and relatable experience, easily visualized.)

### Third Quarter: 
_That scene where Sen is on the train, riding through the water with no-face following her? That *perfectly* captured the surreal experience of being alone and unable to communicate in an alien land._
- **Valence**: 0.7 (Positive in that it articulates a moment that evokes strong feelings, even if related to loneliness.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (Again, it's a subjective interpretation of art without assertion over others’ views.)
- **Intensity**: 0.8 (The word "perfectly" and the description of a "surreal experience" amplify feelings.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.9 (Very specific imagery is provided, making it highly relatable.)

### Fourth Quarter: 
_It's moments like that that make Ghibli awesome. Not the artwork; not the story per se (although _Princess Mononoke_ is an amazing story): the fleeting momentary encapsulation of feeling in the form of art._
- **Valence**: 0.7 (Positively expresses appreciation for moments in Ghibli films.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (Proclaims a personal view but does not assert a preference in a dominating manner.)
- **Intensity**: 0.7 (Words like "awesome" and "momentary encapsulation" convey a strong sense of appreciation.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (While defining what makes Ghibli appealing, it still remains somewhat abstract.)

### Summary of Ratings:
- **First Quarter**: Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Second Quarter**: Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.8
- **Third Quarter**: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.9
- **Fourth Quarter**: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.7

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To rate the argument in quarters based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will assess each aspect as described:

**1st Quarter: "This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film."**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative; expresses frustration or dismissal)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong; the speaker asserts their perspective firmly)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; the tone is assertive but not overly aggressive)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Fairly concrete; makes a claim about the inability to change opinions but lacks specific examples)

**2nd Quarter: "However, I can assure you that nobody is 'faking' their love for these movies, as you suggest."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive; aims to defend the sincerity of others’ opinions)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Moderate-Strong; stands against the previous claim with authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate; somewhat calmer than the first quarter)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (More concrete; directly addresses the assertion of insincerity)

**3rd Quarter: "It's not even as though there's some intellectual clout to be gained by claiming to like movies that are largely indistinguishable to non-fans from trashy mecha anime."**
- **Valence:** 0.1 (Negative; uses sarcasm and belittles an opinion)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Moderate; challenges another viewpoint but is less assertive than earlier)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate-High; some degree of sarcasm and hostility)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete; provides a comparison to illustrate the argument)

**4th Quarter: "Miyazaki's films have strong, rounded characters, beautiful imagery, fantastic music, and inventive, original plots (who the hell else has ever made a decent movie about a supernatural bathhouse?)."**
- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive; praises the films and highlights their qualities)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less dominant; this part is more informative than assertive)

**Summary of Ratings:**
- **1st Quarter:** Valence 0.2, Dominance 0.7, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.5
