Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To evaluate the argument you've provided, I'll break it down into its four quarters and then assign ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. 

1. **Quarter 1: "I feel like you're assuming that people will somehow be perfectly competent at avoiding 'x'."**
   - **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; the statement expresses skepticism without strong positive or negative feelings.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.4 (Some assertiveness is present, but it's largely questioning.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.4 (The intensity is moderate; there's a clear challenge, but not strong emotional weight.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The idea of competence is concrete, although it's somewhat abstract in terms of application.)

2. **Quarter 2: "There are scenarios I can think of where a society desires 'y' and desires to avoid 'x', but, even while trying to avoid 'x', is unable to."**
   - **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive; acknowledging the complexity of desires suggests an understanding of human nature.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (Ultimately positioning a valid counter-argument, but still somewhat cautious.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; expresses a significant point regarding capabilities and outcomes.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The scenarios mentioned give a more tangible context but remain somewhat abstract.)

3. **Quarter 3: "An example would be something like legalising prostitution promoting something like sex trafficking, slavery or sex tourism."**
   - **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative; the examples given are inherently negative and highlight risks.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (More assertive as it presents clear examples that challenge the original argument.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (Higher intensity due to the serious nature of the issues discussed.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Highly concrete; real-world examples make the argument tangible.)

4. **Quarter 4: "Of course *minimisation* is always possible, but it's silly to dismiss claims like those above outright simply because minimisation will be aimed for."**
   - **Valence:** 0.4 (Slightly negative; it critiques the notion of just focusing on minimization.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly asserts the importance of acknowledging the risks involved.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity; urging consideration rather than dismissal.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The argument is clear but also involves abstract reasoning regarding minimization.)

Overall, the argument presents a thoughtful critique regarding the oversimplification of people's capacity to avoid negative outcomes when pursuing particular desires.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument using the specified criteria (valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness), I will provide a score for each of the four quarters of text.

### Quarter 1: 
"When you're a teen it is often said that when you first learn to drive or get a car all your expenses will go up. Not just car related ones."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Somewhat positive, suggesting that gaining independence can be seen positively, but mentions expenses which carries a negative connotation)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Presents a common social observation without strong authority)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate intensity; while it's a relatable statement, it lacks emotional strength)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete in its observations about expenses related to driving)

### Quarter 2: 
"And this is true. When people have more access to options to spend their money, the car, they will spend more money."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; states a fact without emotional weight)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Leans toward a more authoritative tone by stating that what came before is true)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; recognizes a significant relationship but without strong emotional appeal)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Very concrete, explaining a direct cause-and-effect relationship)

### Quarter 3:
"There are lots of things that naturally lead into other things..."

- **Valence:** 0.4 (More negative; implies an inevitability that might not be desirable)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Less authoritative; a general statement that lacks specificity)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (Low emotional intensity; the observation is presented very calmly)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat abstract; while it makes a valid point, itâ€™s more philosophical)

### Quarter 4:
"...and there isn't anything you can do to stop that relationship."

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative; suggests a sense of resignation or lack of control)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (It carries an authoritative tone about inevitability but is somewhat generic)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate; there's a degree of frustration about the lack of control)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat concrete in the argument for inevitability but lacks specific examples)

### Summary of Scores
1. **Quarter 1:** Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.7
2. **Quarter 2:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.8
3. **Quarter 3:** Valence: 0.4, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.5
4. **Quarter 4:** Valence: 0.3, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.6
