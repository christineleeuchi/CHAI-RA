- **Dominance:** 0.2 (Submissive tone; does not assert control)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate level of intensity)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Somewhat abstract as it is mostly agreeing)

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Skeptical and cautionary stance)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Raises questions and challenges, but is not overly assertive)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (High intensity due to the strong language like "brutal")

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Maintains a neutral to negative tone regarding the complexity of the issue)

- **Valence:** 0.2 (Negative conclusion implying hopelessness)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced, but indicates resignation)

Here's a rating for each of the requested dimensions based on the argument provided:

1. **Valence**: 0.7 
   - The argument expresses a positive valence towards the current state of the Constitution, emphasizing that it should remain unchanged. However, there is a slight negative undertone when addressing those who advocate for change, especially with the term "ignorant" used in reference to perspectives on the Second Amendment.

2. **Dominance**: 0.6 
   - The author presents a strong, assertive stance on their opinion about the Constitution, indicating a level of confidence in their argument. However, there is also an invitation for further discussion with the question posed at the end, which suggests a somewhat lower level of dominance compared to an argument that does not entertain counterpoints.

3. **Intensity**: 0.5 
   - The intensity of the argument is moderate. It conveys conviction but lacks highly emotive language or strong persuasive techniques. The author maintains a rational tone throughout and does not resort to extreme expressions of frustration or anger.

4. **Concreteness**: 0.6 
   - There are concrete references to specific aspects of the Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment. However, the argument could benefit from more specific examples of why the existing amendments should not be changed or combined, leading to a somewhat lower score in concreteness.

Overall, these ratings reflect the nuanced nature of the argument, balancing affirmations of the Constitution's value with acknowledgement of the need for accessible language.
