Here’s the rating for each category—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—based on the provided argument. The scores range from 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high):

1. **Valence (0.6)**: The argument presents a mix of positive and negative sentiments. It acknowledges the potential downsides of decontrolling rent and suggests that there may be better alternatives, leading to a somewhat neutral/probably negative tone overall. It reflects skepticism toward the proposed policy but doesn't outright reject it.

2. **Dominance (0.5)**: The argument doesn’t particularly assert dominance; it is more of an exploration of the complexity surrounding the issue of rent regulation. The author presents points for consideration rather than establishing a strong, dominant position. As it stands, there's a balance between presenting arguments in opposition to decontrol and recognizing the potential merits.

3. **Intensity (0.7)**: The intensity is fairly high, given the urgency implied in discussing "painful transition periods" and the real-world ramifications of theoretical ideas. The use of strong terms like “intense backlash” and phrases that indicate potential conflict suggests a strong feeling about the topic, increasing the overall intensity level.

4. **Concreteness (0.8)**: The argument is quite concrete, as it references specific policies, potential outcomes, and links to other forms of tax reform as alternatives. It frames the discussion around empirical evidence and historical analysis, which adds a substantial basis for the claims being made, giving it a defined structure and tangible focus.

Overall, the argument is well-rounded and thoughtful, with areas of skepticism and recognition of complexities involved in rent regulation and decontrol.
