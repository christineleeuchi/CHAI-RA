Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To provide a rating for the specified aspects – valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness – I will break down the argument into quarters and evaluate each quarter against these criteria:

### Quarter 1:
**Text:** "They posted it to appear on their friend's news feeds to be found serendipitously, not to browse all at once. That's why 'it showed up on my news feed' is the classic defence to that."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Mixed; it reflects a mild sense of frustration over the misuse of serendipity in social media, suggesting a nuanced view rather than outright negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Neutral; the speaker is asserting a perspective but does not take a commanding or aggressive stance.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Moderate; the argument makes a point but it's more explanatory than emotionally charged.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Fairly concrete; uses specific language about social media mechanics and references a common defense.)

### Quarter 2:
**Text:** "It's like the difference between reading a magazine that has pictures of someone and specifically seeking out all the magazines you can find with pictures of that person, cutting them all out, and putting them in a scrapbook."

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive; the analogy helps clarify a point in a relatable way, though it carries an underlying critique.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (Less dominant; it's more reflective, using an analogy rather than asserting authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; the analogy enhances understanding but retains a rational tone.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Highly concrete; the analogy is vivid and relatable, making the distinction clear.)

### Quarter 3:
**Text:** "It shows that you have a level of interest in that person that is disconcerting – you want to find out lots of information about that person and follow their life without their involvement, consent or knowledge."

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Negative; expresses concern and disapproval regarding the motivations behind the actions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Assertive; the tone is more commanding, positing a strong judgement about behavior.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (High; there’s a clear emotional response that conveys a strong opinion.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat concrete; while it expresses ideas about privacy, it is less tangible than the previous analogy.)

### Summary of scores:
- **Quarter 1:**
  - Valence: 0.6
  - Dominance: 0.5
  - Intensity: 0.4
  - Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 2:**
  - Valence: 0.7
  - Dominance: 0.3
  - Intensity: 0.5
  - Concreteness: 0.8
- **Quarter 3:**
  - Valence: 0.8
  - Dominance: 0.7
  - Intensity: 0.6
  - Concreteness: 0.6

These scores are subjective evaluations based on the characteristics of each section of the argument presented.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument based on the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text, I will provide scores from 0.0 to 1.0.

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The argument has a somewhat negative undertone, emphasizing discomfort, but acknowledges the right to feelings.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a clear stance regarding social norms and boundaries.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The phrasing indicates a strong belief about respecting discomfort and boundaries.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (It uses abstract concepts like boundaries and social norms, but lacks specific examples initially.)

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral to slightly negative; presents an opposing view but is more analytical.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker seeks to bring attention to misassumptions about online postings.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There’s a moderate emphasis on misunderstanding the intent behind social media posts.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Uses a specific analogy of a coffee shop conversation to clarify the argument.)

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.4 (More neutral and reflective, as it discusses the implications of perceived boundaries.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Maintains a balanced view but suggests that there are different social norms.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument has a measured tone without aggressive language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (More concrete as it uses metaphors like "an unlocked door" that clarify the intended idea.)

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.4 (This section retains a neutral tone and acknowledges discomfort without strong negativity.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker reiterates existing social norms but acknowledges variability within them.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The discussion is more about social acceptance and feelings rather than confrontational.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (It mentions the discomfort associated with being researched online but could benefit from more specifics.)

Overall, the argument presents a thoughtful perspective on social boundaries in the online realm, balancing between asserting personal rights and recognizing social norms.
