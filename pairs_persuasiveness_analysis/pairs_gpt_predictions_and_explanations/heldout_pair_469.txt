Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To analyze the given argument based on the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break it down into four quarters and provide a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each dimension.

### Quarter 1: "Even if you are completely right on all of your points people are still not morally obligated to watch."
- **Valence**: 0.3 (The statement has a neutral tone, presenting a counter-argument but lacking emotional positivity or negativity.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (The speaker expresses a personal viewpoint against the obligation to watch, indicating some assertion of control over the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.2 (The statement is relatively mild in intensity, making a factual assertion without strong emotional language.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (The argument is somewhat concrete in its assertion of people not being obligated, but lacks specific examples.)

### Quarter 2: "People are not obligated to understand what it is like."
- **Valence**: 0.4 (This maintains a neutral tone but suggests a certain disconnection or apathy towards understanding, which could be seen as slightly negative.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (This asserts a strong stance on the idea that obligation to understand is not present, reflecting a balanced power in the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.3 (Still mild but slightly more intense than the previous quarter due to the implications of emotional detachment.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.4 (This is a more direct assertion but still lacks specific examples or context to anchor it.)

### Quarter 3: "It might be better if they did but they are not obligated."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (This section introduces a comparative value ("it might be better"), making it more positive overall.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (While it provides a counterpoint, the speaker still maintains a clear dominance by stating no obligation exists.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The phrase "it might be better" softens the claim but still adds a reasonable intensity regarding the moral consideration.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (This quarter is reasonably concrete, acknowledging a suggestion while maintaining the argument's central premise.)

### Quarter 4: "Maybe we have a difference in moral philosophy but I personally believe you cannot be morally obligated to do something if not doing it doesn't actively hurt anybody."
- **Valence**: 0.5 (This portion shows a more balanced perspective, recognizing a difference in moral philosophy which can be seen as positive.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker asserts their belief, indicating strong personal moral authority over this viewpoint.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The assertion contains moderate intensity, particularly with the phrasing regarding moral obligation.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (This quarter articulates a specific belief and links it to the concept of harm, providing a clearer argument.)

### Summary of Ratings:
1. **Quarter 1**: Valence 0.3, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.2, Concreteness 0.5
2. **Quarter 2**: Valence 0.4, Dominance 0.5, Intensity 0.3, Concreteness 0.4
3. **Quarter 3**: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.4, Intensity 0.4, Concreteness 0.5
4. **Quarter 4**: Valence 0.5, Dominance 0.6, Intensity 0.5, Concreteness 0.6

These scores reflect the varied emotional and logical elements across the argument as expressed in the four quarters.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument you’ve presented, we can assign scores for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness in each quarter of the text.

**1st Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.3)**: The tone is generally negative, as it opposes the idea of watching the videos.
- **Dominance (0.5)**: The argument is assertive but acknowledges the opposing view briefly.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The argument has a moderate level of intensity, expressing concerns about the obligation to help victims.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The argument presents a somewhat abstract idea (the obligation to help) without specific examples yet.

**2nd Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.2)**: This section presents a very negative view of the implications of watching the videos.
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The speaker asserts their viewpoint strongly, suggesting that the original premise may be misguided.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The emotional weight increases as they critique the motivations behind ISIS’s publicity.
- **Concreteness (0.4)**: The statements are somewhat abstract again, with more emphasis on the negative consequences without specific examples yet.

**3rd Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.2)**: The focus remains on the negative aspects of viewing the videos and their potential effects.
- **Dominance (0.7)**: The argument strongly asserts that watching the videos could be harmful, reinforcing their position effectively.
- **Intensity (0.8)**: There is a high emotional intensity here, reflecting outrage and concern over the potential outcomes.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The mention of hostages, political responses, and recruitment provides some concrete examples, but it could be further elaborated.

**4th Quarter:**
- **Valence (0.1)**: The conclusion is quite negative, positing a world without terrorism publicity as ideal, which frames the argument pessimistically.
- **Dominance (0.8)**: The tone is highly assertive, firmly opposing the viewing of the execution videos.
- **Intensity (0.9)**: This is the most intense part of the argument, encapsulating strong feelings about the harmful nature of publicity surrounding terrorism.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: The vision of a world without publicized terrorism adds some concrete imagery to the argument.

Overall, the scores reflect a strong opposition to the idea of watching execution videos, with a consistent theme of negativity and concern about the consequences of such actions.
