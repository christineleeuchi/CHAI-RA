Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here are the ratings for each quarter of the argument based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### Quarter 1:
- **Valence**: 0.4 (The argument introduces a skeptical view of the claim of hyper-rationality; it's somewhat negative toward that idea.)
- **Dominance**: 0.6 (The speaker is asserting their perspective against the original argument, showing some confidence.)
- **Intensity**: 0.5 (The tone is moderately intense as it challenges the existing notion, but lacks strong emotional language.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 (References to voting habits provide some concrete examples, but they aren't fully fleshed out yet.)

### Quarter 2:
- **Valence**: 0.5 (This section maintains a critical stance, but it also opens up to broader human behavior, which could be perceived neutrally.)
- **Dominance**: 0.5 (The argument continues to assert a counterpoint, but it's less dominant as it branches into general observations.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (There's a stronger assertion of human irrationality that infuses this part with a bit more intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Specific examples of voting criteria show a higher degree of concreteness.)

### Quarter 3:
- **Valence**: 0.5 (This part continues the critical vein, but without strong negative emotion, maintaining neutrality.)
- **Dominance**: 0.4 (This section is somewhat less dominant as it starts listing behavior examples rather than arguing against a claim directly.)
- **Intensity**: 0.4 (The intensity remains moderate but lacks the forcefulness of earlier sections.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Examples of behaviors (TV watching, consumption) are different forms of concrete behavior that illustrate the argument.)

### Quarter 4:
- **Valence**: 0.6 (The conclusion leans positively towards an alternative explanation rather than the original idea of hyper-rationality.)
- **Dominance**: 0.7 (This section is assertive in presenting a rationale grounded in modern incentives, showing dominance in the argument.)
- **Intensity**: 0.6 (There's a more forthright expression of reasoning that gives the argument some intensity.)
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 (The last quarter provides well-defined examples of modern incentives, making it highly concrete.)

These scores reflect the various aspects of the argument presented in each quarter while considering the nuanced delivery and examples used throughout.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To rate the argument provided in each quarter of the text, I will consider the four dimensions: valence (positive or negative tone), dominance (authority or assertiveness), intensity (strength of conviction), and concreteness (level of detail and specificity). 

**Quarter 1: "There is a different between someone's proposed reasons..."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is somewhat negative regarding the reasons people give for not wanting children.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts a strong perspective on the distinction between stated and actual reasons.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is conviction in the argument, but it could use more passionate language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is clear, but it uses general terms without providing a detailed, specific example to illustrate the point.)

**Quarter 2: "As a source for the assertion above..."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (This section carries a neutral tone as it focuses on citing sources rather than expressing strong opinions.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The commentary is more observational and does not assertively contribute to the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.3 (There’s minimal emotional engagement or strength in the language used here.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The use of a specific Reddit comment provides a concrete example, though the overall connection to the argument isn’t deeply elaborated.)

**Quarter 3: "There is still a strong social pressure to procreate..."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (The tone remains neutral but leans slightly towards a critical view of societal norms.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The assertion about social pressures is presented with confidence.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument maintains a decent level of intensity, but more fervent language could strengthen it.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Offers contextual specifics regarding Sweden and its policies, but could provide more data to strengthen the argument.)

**Quarter 4: "Rationality doesn't seem to be causing people..."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is somewhat assertive about rationality’s perceived impact, leaning towards a critical view.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strongly states the argument against the idea that rational decision-making overrides instinct.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Uses assertive language to reinforce that emotional factors are still influential.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Although it brings up the idea that emotional factors still play a role, it lacks detailed specific examples or evidence to support the claim fully.)

These scores reflect the nuances in each section of the argument, considering the dimensions you requested.
