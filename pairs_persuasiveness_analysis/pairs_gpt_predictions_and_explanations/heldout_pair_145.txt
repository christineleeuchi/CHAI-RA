Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a breakdown of the ratings for each quarter of the argument text you provided, based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

### 1st Quarter: "The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for"
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Positive aspect of zoos caring for animals is emphasized)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The argument is not particularly strong yet; it presents a perspective without asserting power over the counter-argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity, as it discusses a significant point about endangered species)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Somewhat concrete as it references the care of endangered animals, though specifics on what 'care' means are lacking)

### 2nd Quarter: "either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild."
- **Valence:** 0.4 (Neutral to slightly negative due to acknowledgment of the limitations of releasing zoo animals)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (Argument is countered immediately with a significant point about their inability to survive in the wild)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Medium intensity regarding the species preservation point but quickly undermined by counter-claims)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (It has some elements of concreteness but lacks detail on how species would actually be preserved)

### 3rd Quarter: "zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it recognizes a potential positive but questions its effectiveness)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The argument isn’t particularly strong; it’s followed by skepticism about its impact)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate intensity but lacking strong evidence)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (Concrete enough to understand the idea but lacks empirical support)

### 4th Quarter: "Though, mostly zoo life for animals is a lot like prison life for humans..."
- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative because it paints a grim picture of life in zoos)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong dominance, as it effectively counters the previous point and presents a vivid analogy)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity due to the emotional weight of comparing zoo life to prison life)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Concrete in drawing strong parallels between human imprisonment and animal captivity)

### Summary Ratings
1st Quarter: Valence 0.7 | Dominance 0.5 | Intensity 0.6 | Concreteness 0.6  
2nd Quarter: Valence 0.4 | Dominance 0.4 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.5  
3rd Quarter: Valence 0.5 | Dominance 0.4 | Intensity 0.5 | Concreteness 0.5  
4th Quarter: Valence 0.3 | Dominance 0.7 | Intensity 0.8 | Concreteness 0.7  

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To evaluate the argument provided in four quarters, we can assign scores from 0.0 to 1.0 in the categories of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness. Here's a breakdown of the argument:

**Quarter 1: "endangered animals can be cared for: It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 - While it starts with an acknowledgment that caring for endangered animals is true, it quickly turns negative by emphasizing limitations.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The speaker asserts their point about the small portion of animals that benefit from this care, positioning themselves with authority.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The intensity of the argument is moderate; it's more of a critique than a strong emotional appeal.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - The argument is concrete as it deals with measurable facts about the proportion of endangered animals being protected.

**Quarter 2: "The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational."**
- **Valence:** 0.4 - The comment is critical and negative, indicating a strong disapproval of the methods used for animal protection.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - This statement makes a claim but lacks strong authoritative backing or evidence to dominate the discourse.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - The use of the word "wildly" adds intensity to the critique, suggesting passion or strong disagreement.
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 - The argument is somewhat abstract as it does not provide specific examples or reasoning for why the rationale is deemed irrational.

**Quarter 3: "Most of these animals are 'exotic' and your concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals' former countries."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 - This part is somewhat neutral; it acknowledges the “exotic” nature of the animals but suggests limitations in the effectiveness of concern.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The speaker confidently states a viewpoint about the lack of impact, asserting a position.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The phrase has a moderate intensity but lacks strong emotional language.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - It is concrete in that it refers to “exotic” animals and suggests a clear limitation to concern.

**Quarter 4: "there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage..."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 - This has a negative valence since it raises the ethical concern of enslavement, which is a strong critique of zoos.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The claim has a degree of authority but depends on the acceptance of the term "enslave," which can be contentious.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 - The language used (“enslave them”) elevates the emotional intensity considerably, indicating strong moral outrage.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - The argument references specific alternatives but is still somewhat generalized in its suggestion.

Overall, the ratings reflect the mixed emotional and rational qualities of the provided argument, balancing critique with acknowledgment of different perspectives.
