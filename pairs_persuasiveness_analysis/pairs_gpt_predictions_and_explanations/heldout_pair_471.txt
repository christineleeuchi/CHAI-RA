Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To rate the argument provided in terms of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will assess each quarter of the text separately.

1. **First Quarter: "Situation you describe is only possible for a few decades, in developed enough countries, and among people that do well enough for themselves."**
   - **Valence:** 0.7 (The tone seems somewhat critical of the situation described but does not express strong negativity.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (The statement asserts knowledge about socio-economic realities and indicates a level of authority.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.5 (The assertion is moderate; it conveys a clear point without excessive emotional charge.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The argument presents a concrete context—developed countries and socio-economic conditions.)

2. **Second Quarter: "In any other circumstances, family is pretty much instrumental for survival (mostly when kids are involved of course)."**
   - **Valence:** 0.8 (This part has a more positive perspective on family, seen as essential for survival.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.5 (Establishes an important point but does not dominate the overall conversation.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity, emphasizing the importance of family.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The argument references tangible concepts like family and survival, but it remains somewhat abstract.)

3. **Third Quarter: "In most cases, family only works well with monogamy."**
   - **Valence:** 0.6 (This suggests a positive view on monogamy but could also suggest an exclusionary view.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong assertion about the relationship between family and monogamy, giving it weight.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.6 (A clear assertion that carries some emotional weight about relationships.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Specific terms like family and monogamy lend a level of concreteness to the argument.)

4. **Fourth Quarter: "So more accurate, the 'norm' should be understanding and honoring the agreement you enter in."**
   - **Valence:** 0.9 (This is a positive assertion about personal agreements and respect.)
   - **Dominance:** 0.6 (Advocates for a perspective that is less domineering and more empathetic.)
   - **Intensity:** 0.8 (Strong emphasis on understanding and honoring agreements, conveying passion.)
   - **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While it speaks to agreements, the inherently subjective nature makes it somewhat abstract.)

These scores provide a quantitative understanding of the characteristics of each segment of the argument as it addresses the complexities of relationships, societal norms, and personal autonomy.

Certainly! Here’s a breakdown of the argument you provided, along with a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the given dimensions:

### Quarter 1: "Most people want an exclusive relationship so exclusive relationships are the norm."
