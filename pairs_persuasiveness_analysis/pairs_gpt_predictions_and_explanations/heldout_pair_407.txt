Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here's a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the specified attributes of the given argument:

### Valence: 0.5 
The argument presents a somewhat neutral position. While it highlights a lack of impact for the "no confidence" choice and references lower voter turnout in Nevada, it does not strongly lean towards a positive or negative tone regarding the effectiveness of such choices. 

### Dominance: 0.4
The dominance is relatively low as the argument mainly reflects a personal opinion and lacks strong authority or persuasive evidence to assert dominance over opposing views. It acknowledges the limitations of the "none of these candidates" choice without strongly advocating for or against it. 

### Intensity: 0.3 
The intensity is low since the argument does not express strong emotions or fervor about the subject. It presents observations rather than passionate advocacy, making it more analytical than emotionally charged.

### Concreteness: 0.6 
The argument contains specific references, such as the existence of the "none of these candidates" choice in Nevada and historical voter turnout data. However, it could benefit from more detailed examples or broader implications to enhance its concreteness further.

Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the dimensions — valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness — based on each quarter of the argument's text:

### 1st Quarter
**Text:** "What would the purpose of this vote be? I mean, you can't just elect nobody?"
- **Valence:** 0.4 (The tone is somewhat skeptical about the purpose of the vote, leaning negative.)
- **Dominance:** 0.3 (The speaker expresses doubt but does not strongly assert a position of power.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The questioning tone indicates a moderate level of intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (The ideas presented are somewhat abstract, focusing more on questioning rather than concrete examples.)

### 2nd Quarter
**Text:** "When there is an election, somehow, a decision has to be made. And in a democracy, it is normally the people deciding which one from the list of candidates they want to choose. However, electing nobody is not a choice."
- **Valence:** 0.6 (The tone is more neutral with a hint of frustration, reflecting a critical view on the choices available.)
- **Dominance:** 0.4 (The argument seeks to clarify the voting process but does not strongly lead the discussion.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The statement carries a sense of urgency in conveying the necessity of making a decision.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The concepts of elections and democracy are fairly concrete and widely understood.)

### 3rd Quarter
**Text:** "Therefore I think adding a 'no confidence' would only encourage the average voter to distance himself from every candidate and refuse his vote."
- **Valence:** 0.5 (The evaluation of adding "no confidence" is mixed, presenting both a potential critique and a recognition of voter sentiment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker expresses their opinion clearly but does not assert dominance over differing views.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (The argument indicates a strong belief in the negative implications of the proposed change.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The concept of voter distancing is somewhat abstract but can be understood through examples.)

### 4th Quarter
**Text:** "If someone is really unhappy about the way politics work, he should be able to participate himself as a politician. (I wrote should, because it is in many cases not very easy to do so) If many people are unhappy with the voting system, maybe this could be revised in a way which encourages more voters to participate instead of refusing their vote."
- **Valence:** 0.7 (The suggestion promotes participation and improvement, reflecting a positive outlook.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker advocates for personal involvement and systemic change, positioning themselves as part of a solution.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The call to action and acknowledgment of difficulties reflects a high level of intensity regarding voter engagement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (While the argument suggests solutions, it remains a bit vague regarding specific changes to the voting system.)

Overall, the argument demonstrates a journey through skepticism, critique, and ultimately advocacy for change, reflected in the varying scores across each quarter.
