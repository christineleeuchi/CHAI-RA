Here's my rating for each aspect of the argument divided into four quarters of the text regarding military threats and the potential for a draft in response to large-scale natural disasters:

**Quarter 1 (Introduction of the scenario):**
- **Valence:** 0.7 - The tone is largely neutral but suggests concern about potential serious events.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The argument introduces the idea of military threats but is not overwhelmingly assertive; it presents possibilities rather than certainties.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - There's a moderate level of urgency implied in the potential outcomes of such disasters.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - The scenarios raised are somewhat abstract; they represent likely hypothetical situations rather than specific, tangible incidents.

**Quarter 2 (Description of impacts):**
- **Valence:** 0.6 - The implications of these disasters carry a predominantly negative connotation, reflecting potential chaos and need for intervention.
- **Dominance:** 0.6 - The argument becomes more forceful as it elaborates on negative outcomes, emphasizing the potential scale of the situation.
- **Intensity:** 0.7 - The imagery of civil disorder and resource disruption creates a heightened sense of urgency and gravity.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - The issues related to civil disorder, food supply, and refugees are more concrete and relatable than the initial scenarios.

**Quarter 3 (Military intervention necessity):**
- **Valence:** 0.7 - The need for military intervention suggests a very serious situation, which maintains a negative valence.
- **Dominance:** 0.7 - There’s a stronger assertion about the necessity of military involvement, reinforcing the argument's focus.
- **Intensity:** 0.8 - The intensity escalates here, as the implications become more direct and pressing regarding the need for a large military response.
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 - While the call for military involvement is more specific, it still hinges on hypothetical future events, which slightly reduces concreteness.

**Quarter 4 (Possibility of a draft):**
- **Valence:** 0.5 - The notion of a draft carries negative connotations but presents it as a potential necessity rather than an indictment.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - While the argument acknowledges the potential for a draft, it doesn't dominate the conversation as it hints at solutions rather than problems.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The intensity here is moderate; the seriousness of a draft is acknowledged, but it's positioned as a response to events that have not yet occurred.
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 - This section addresses a significant aspect of the military response, but once again, it remains somewhat abstract as it's contingent on hypothetical disasters.

Overall, the argument presents a valid point regarding the military's role in disaster response, which could necessitate a draft. However, much of the hypothetical nature of the scenarios reduces some of the intensity and concreteness of the argument.

Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the specified dimensions of the argument, divided into quarters:

### Argument Assessment Scores

1. **Valence**: 
   - **Score**: 0.7 
   - **Explanation**: The argument has a moderately positive valence since it presents a scenario where conscription could be deemed necessary for national security. However, the idea of the draft itself is generally viewed negatively by many segments of the population.

2. **Dominance**: 
   - **Score**: 0.6 
   - **Explanation**: The argument asserts that the US will revert to a draft based on a need for manpower, suggesting a strong position. However, this dominance is countered by societal changes and historical contexts that have made the draft less likely, indicating a certain level of tension in its dominance.

3. **Intensity**: 
   - **Score**: 0.8 
   - **Explanation**: The argument is intense in its assertion that a draft will return if volunteers don’t meet requirements, evoking significant emotions tied to the idea of service, war, and national obligation. The reference to historical precedents like World War II strengthens this intensity.

4. **Concreteness**: 
   - **Score**: 0.7 
   - **Explanation**: The argument is relatively concrete, using specific historical examples (e.g., WW2) and quantifiable data (numbers of draftees) to support its claims. However, predictions about society's future actions and motivations—such as responses to potential drafts—are inherently more abstract and less concrete.

### Summary
Overall, the argument presents a strong case for the potential reinstatement of the draft based on historical precedents and current volunteer trends, though it faces challenges from shifts in societal attitudes toward military service and personal freedom.
