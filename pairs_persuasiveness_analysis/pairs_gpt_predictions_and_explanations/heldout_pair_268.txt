To provide a rating score for the argument based on the criteria of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will break down each quarter of the argument and assess each criterion accordingly.

**First Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.6 - This part of the argument is largely neutral, providing an appreciation of differing perspectives, but acknowledges that some individuals may have less favorable views on promiscuity.
- **Dominance:** 0.4 - The argument presents a clear perspective but does not overly assert authority, showing understanding of opposing views.
- **Intensity:** 0.5 - The intensity is moderate as it presents a critical reflection without being overly passionate or aggressive.
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 - The argument provides specific references to examples from the OP’s statements about preferences; however, broad concepts of societal acceptance are somewhat generalized.

**Second Quarter:**
- **Valence:** 0.7 - This section introduces a more empathetic viewpoint, positively framing understanding of the OP's perspective while still questioning it.
- **Dominance:** 0.5 - The author offers personal insight while respecting the OP's context, creating a balance rather than a strong dominance.
- **Intensity:** 0.6 - There is a slight increase in intensity as the author begins to challenge the OP’s assumptions about promiscuity constructs.
