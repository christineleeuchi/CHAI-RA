Sure! Here’s a breakdown of the argument you provided, rated on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the argument.

### Quarter 1
**Text:** "Why should everyone get 'equal education, equal opportunity?' If a kid doesn't want to learn, or doesn't want to succeed, why would you teach the same to him and to a kid who wants to excel and succeed in school?"

- **Valence:** 0.4 (The sentiment is somewhat negative as it implies frustration with the idea of equal education for disinterested students.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts their perspective but acknowledges that there’s a debate to be had here.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (The argument reflects a sense of passion about the issue but is more questioning than assertive.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (The points made are fairly clear and straightforward, though not grounded in specific examples.)

### Quarter 2
**Text:** "If someone wants to excel in their studies, they should be able to go to a 'better' private school and get a 'better' education."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (This statement is neutral, indicating a belief that options for different education types are valid, though it leans towards the positive for advocates of private schools.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker's perspective on private schools suggests a value placed on educational hierarchy.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The argument states a belief without strong emotional wording, though there's an underlying conviction.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The idea is clear, but the definition of "better" is left vague.)

### Quarter 3
**Text:** "Private school being 'better' is also kind of vague. For education, you get out what you put in."

- **Valence:** 0.6 (This introduces a more constructive perspective, implying that effort is key to education.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker is assertively claiming that the quality of education is subjective and depends on the student.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (The tone is somewhat moderated but confident in asserting a general principle about education.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This segment presents a clear thought that aligns well with the argument.)

### Quarter 4
**Text:** "Students in private schools most likely put more effort in to their education, so on average they come out in a better position than an average student in a public school. More effort = better education = 'better' school."

- **Valence:** 0.5 (The claim is more neutral, presenting an observation rather than an emotionally charged statement.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (This portion displays confidence in the viewpoint that effort correlates strongly with educational outcomes.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (There is a level of conviction here, though it's still somewhat restrained.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (The conclusion is clear and based on a logical sequence, making the argument easy to follow.)

By evaluating each quarter separately, we can see the nuances in the argument across various dimensions.
