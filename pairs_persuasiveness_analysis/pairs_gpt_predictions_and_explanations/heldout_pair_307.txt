Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To provide a rating for the argument based on the categories you've mentioned, I will break it down into four quarters and then assess each quarter for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness.

**Quarter 1: Introduction and Background**
- **Valence (0.7)**: The author is informative and positive about their background, which sets a neutral to slightly positive tone.
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The author establishes authority through their experience, giving them a dominant position in the discussion.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The tone is moderate, neither overly forceful nor very subdued.
- **Concreteness (0.5)**: The background information is somewhat abstract, though it does provide context.

**Quarter 2: The Argument Against Bar Soap as the Only Solution**
- **Valence (0.5)**: The discussion is somewhat neutral, as it outlines the limitations of bar soap without extreme negativity.
- **Dominance (0.7)**: The author asserts their expertise, gaining a stronger position as they introduce scientific concepts.
- **Intensity (0.6)**: The argument has a noticeable intensity as it counters a strong claim about bar soap.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: There is a fair amount of concrete information about skin types and pH levels supporting their arguments.

**Quarter 3: Specialized Products and Personal Experience**
- **Valence (0.6)**: The tone here is reassuring, emphasizing that specialized products can lead to improvement.
- **Dominance (0.7)**: The authoritative voice continues, influencing the reader to consider their perspective seriously.
- **Intensity (0.7)**: The urgency in promoting tailored products increases the intensity of the argument.
- **Concreteness (0.7)**: Examples provided about different skin and hair types make it more concrete.

**Quarter 4: Summary and Personal Projections**
- **Valence (0.5)**: The conclusion returns to a neutral tone, acknowledging the reality of individual needs.
- **Dominance (0.6)**: The author maintains authority but also acknowledges the limits of their knowledge and guesses.
- **Intensity (0.5)**: The intensity is steady but not as heightened as in earlier quarters.
- **Concreteness (0.6)**: The personal assessments, while speculative, provide detail and some level of groundedness.

### Overall Scores
- **Valence**: 0.57 (overall positive with variations)
- **Dominance**: 0.65 (authoritative throughout)
- **Intensity**: 0.58 (varies but maintains a steady engagement)
- **Concreteness**: 0.57 (a mix of abstract and specific points)

This rating system allows for a detailed analysis of how the argument is presented, incorporating the emotional and intellectual weight of each part as well as its grounding in reality.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
Here’s a breakdown of the argument based on the requested criteria—valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness—using a score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each quarter of the text:

**1st Quarter: "I have a beard. If I get food in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been working on a car or something and get oil in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been doing a bunch of fry cooking and have splashed cooking oil onto my beard shampoo is very much needed."**

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Positive towards the necessity of shampoo in specific dirty scenarios)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The speaker asserts expertise regarding beard care and the need for shampoo)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderately intense as they list multiple situations)
- **Concreteness:** 0.9 (Very concrete examples provided)

**2nd Quarter: "So no, just rinsing is not always sufficient."**

- **Valence:** 0.7 (Negative towards the idea of rinsing only, clearly refuting the opposing view)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Assertive in countering the previous argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Less intense than the first quarter)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (Lacks examples, relying on previously established argument)

**3rd Quarter: "Bar soap is horrid for my beard. It makes it dry and brittle as well as itchy."**

- **Valence:** 0.9 (Strongly negative towards bar soap, portraying it as harmful)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (A strong personal claim about the effects of bar soap)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity regarding the negative effects)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Specific effects on the beard are well-defined)

**4th Quarter: "It is true that daily use of shampoo is not good for hair, and that for many unless they are involved in messy activities do not actually need to shampoo more than once a week one. That truth however does not support your claim that it is wholly unnecessary. All that it takes is one instance that it is necessary to prove you wrong and I listed several. The point of using a body wash is to apply a scent to your body that is lighter than cologne or perfume. The purpose of shampoo is to strip your hair of oils and dirt. They are not a scam, they do what they are intended to do."**

- **Valence:** 0.8 (Balanced, acknowledging some truth but maintaining a positive view on hygiene products)
- **Dominance:** 0.9 (Strongly asserts the necessity of products against an opposing argument)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Moderate intensity in conclusion, combining various points)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Clearly states purposes of shampoo and body wash)

These scores reflect the aspects of the argument in relation to the specified criteria.
