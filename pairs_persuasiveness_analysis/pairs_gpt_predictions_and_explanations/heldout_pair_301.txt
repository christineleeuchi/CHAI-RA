Here’s a rating for each quarter of the argument on the scales of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness:

**1st Quarter: "First off, Clinton was impeached for perjury. The investigation was less about the affair and more about the fact Lewinsky was an intern."**

- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral; the statement presents a fact but does not express strong positive or negative sentiment.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (This quarter asserts a historical fact and positions the speaker's perspective.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate; the use of specific terms like "impeached" and "perjury" conveys significance but lacks emotional intensity.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.8 (Concrete; the information is based on a specific historical event.)

**2nd Quarter: "Anytime a superior engages in a relationship with an intern/employee, there at least a chance that the superior abused their power to lead to that relationship. Even if nothing was done wrong, it give the appearance of impropriety."**

- **Valence:** 0.4 (Slightly negative; suggests possible wrongdoing or moral implications.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (This part asserts a strong viewpoint regarding power dynamics and the implications of relationships.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Some intensity; the phrases used convey a concern about abuse of power.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Fairly concrete; introduces a concept about power dynamics but is somewhat abstract.)

**3rd Quarter: "In situations involving women outside the organization, I don't see it being a problem if the politician is single."**

- **Valence:** 0.6 (Positive; reflects a more permissive view regarding single politicians.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Balanced; presents an opinion but lacks strong emphasis.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (Low; the view expressed is mild and not strongly passionate.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (Moderately concrete; involved opinion but still somewhat abstract.)

**4th Quarter: "However, if the politician is married, it reflects negatively on their character. They have been dishonest and betrayed someone close to them. That should make voters cautious at best."**

- **Valence:** 0.3 (Negative; suggests dishonesty and betrayal reflects poorly on character.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (Strong dominance; character assessment is emphatically stated.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (High intensity; strong emotional language about dishonesty and betrayal.)
