Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
To provide a rating score for the argument across the dimensions of valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I'll break it down into four quarters as requested:

### Quarter 1: "why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive"

- **Valence**: 0.5 - The statement is neutral, seeking to question a prevalent assumption without strong emotional weight.
- **Dominance**: 0.4 - The argument is aimed at challenging mainstream views but does not strongly assert a position of superiority.
- **Intensity**: 0.3 - The intensity is moderate; it's more inquisitive than forceful.
- **Concreteness**: 0.6 - The use of the word "alive" is concrete, but the argument's exploration is more conceptual.

### Quarter 2: "The responsibility argument, yes..."

- **Valence**: 0.6 - The reference to personal responsibility carries a slightly negative implication, especially for those who believe in the sanctity of life.
- **Dominance**: 0.5 - This section begins to assert a more significant stance against the idea that responsibility means carrying to term.
- **Intensity**: 0.7 - The contrast made with car accidents adds intensity to the argument.
- **Concreteness**: 0.5 - While it uses relatable analogies, the comparison could be viewed as abstract.

### Quarter 3: "Many countries have an opt-in system..."

- **Valence**: 0.7 - This section carries a stronger emotional weight regarding bodily autonomy and rights.
- **Dominance**: 0.6 - It positions the idea that forcing a woman to carry a fetus to term violates personal rights quite dominantly.
- **Intensity**: 0.8 - The stark comparison to corpses heightens the emotional intensity of the argument.
- **Concreteness**: 0.7 - The reference to laws and practices in various countries makes this argument more concrete.

### Quarter 4: "a woman is denied an abortion..."

- **Valence**: 0.8 - This has a strong negative emotional valence, emphasizing the injustice faced by women.
- **Dominance**: 0.7 - The point is assertive about the conditions imposed upon women and how they are treated.
- **Intensity**: 0.9 - There is high intensity here, with strong implications that evoke sympathy and urgency.
- **Concreteness**: 0.8 - The comparison of treatment to a corpse is a concrete illustration that makes the argument particularly striking.

### Summary Scores

- **Quarter 1**: Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.4, Intensity: 0.3, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 2**: Valence: 0.6, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.7, Concreteness: 0.5
- **Quarter 3**: Valence: 0.7, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 4**: Valence: 0.8, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.9, Concreteness: 0.8

Overall, the argument evolves in its assertion and emotional appeal, becoming more intense and concrete as it progresses through the quarters.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To rate the argument divided into four quarters based on valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness, I will provide scores from 0.0 (very low) to 1.0 (very high) for each of the categories.

**Quarter 1: "I honestly don't know anyone who is pro abortion. It's a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I'm not sure it's something I would ever choose for myself."**
- **Valence:** 0.3 (The sentiment seems to carry a negative tone regarding the experience of abortion.)
- **Dominance:** 0.2 (The speaker expresses personal feelings but does not assert a strong opinion on others' rights.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (There’s a moderate level of emotional expression regarding the topic.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.4 (It discusses personal reflection, but lacks concrete facts or specific examples.)

**Quarter 2: "But not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone's hard choice to have one."**
- **Valence:** 0.6 (Here, there’s a positive tone in supporting others' rights.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker asserts their opinion about individual rights, showing a moderate level of authority.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (There is a firm but respectful tone towards the choices of others.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.5 (The argument is clearer but still somewhat abstract; it touches on personal freedoms without delving into specific cases.)

**Quarter 3: "A women's right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her."**
- **Valence:** 0.7 (Stronger positive sentiment for women's rights and autonomy.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker asserts a strong argument for women's rights in this context.)
- **Intensity:** 0.7 (Emphasis on the right speaks to a high emotional engagement.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (This statement is more direct and clear about the argument regarding bodily autonomy.)

**Quarter 4: "I think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral, as it tries to articulate a position on rights related to the fetus.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (The speaker presents a clear stance, but it feels more analytical.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Moderate engagement as it includes the conditions under which rights are conferred.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (This final section includes a condition that is somewhat specific and engage with legal or moral reasoning.)

Overall, the scores reflect both emotional engagement and logical reasoning throughout the argument, evolving from more personal reflections in the first quarter to a more assertive and structured conclusion in the last.
