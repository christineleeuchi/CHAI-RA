Expected yes, changed mind. GPT responded: Yes, the provided counterargument changes my mind
Here's a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the specified dimensions of the argument in the text provided:

1. **Valence: 0.4**
   - The valence of the argument is generally negative, as it addresses the untrustworthiness of governments and highlights manipulation and opacity in government actions. However, there are acknowledgments of legitimate reasons for certain government actions which contribute to a more nuanced perspective.

2. **Dominance: 0.5**
   - The argument maintains a neutral dominance; while it critiques government actions and the trustworthiness issue, it does provide counterarguments and acknowledges the need for governmental secrecy in certain scenarios. This balance allows it to engage meaningfully with the opposing view, which keeps it from being overly dominant in its criticisms.

3. **Intensity: 0.6**
   - The intensity of the argument is moderate to high as it presents strong criticisms and serious allegations regarding government behavior and the concept of trust. There is a passionate tone that conveys urgency and frustration over the perceived failure of governments to maintain the social contract.

4. **Concreteness: 0.7**
   - The argument is fairly concrete, as it references specific historical events and established concepts such as the social contract. These examples lend a level of specificity and support to the claims made, making it easier for readers to grasp the author's intentions and line of reasoning. However, some abstract discussions about trust and general governance could be more concretely tied to real-world implications and examples. 

Overall, this assessment reflects an evaluation of how the argument presents its claims, the emotional weight it carries, and how effectively it conveys its message.
