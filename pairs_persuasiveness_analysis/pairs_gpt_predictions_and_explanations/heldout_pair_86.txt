Certainly! Below are the ratings for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness for each quarter of the text in both Problem 1 and Problem 2.

### Problem 1
1. **Quarter 1** 
   - **Valence**: 0.4 (Cautiously negative; suggests a potential for concern)
   - **Dominance**: 0.5 (Neutral; it’s a moderate claim making an observation)
   - **Intensity**: 0.3 (Mild; it's an assertion that provokes thought but lacks strong emotional weight)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Moderate; offers a specific example but abstractly discusses A.I.)

2. **Quarter 2**
   - **Valence**: 0.5 (Neutral; suggests it is reasonable to consider future implications)
   - **Dominance**: 0.5 (Neutral; presenting an opinion without leading or dominating)
   - **Intensity**: 0.4 (Moderate; a sense of potential with A.I. conveys some concern)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.6 (Higher; includes specific terms related to A.I. and actions)

### Problem 2
1. **Quarter 1**
   - **Valence**: 0.5 (Balanced; acknowledges both sides of technology)
   - **Dominance**: 0.6 (Stronger; asserts that the author has a counterpoint to the original argument)
   - **Intensity**: 0.5 (Moderate; reflects a stronger stance against cherry-picking)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.5 (Mix of abstract and concrete examples)

2. **Quarter 2**
   - **Valence**: 0.3 (More negative; highlights dangers associated with technology)
   - **Dominance**: 0.7 (High; strongly argues against the idea that technology is inherently good)
   - **Intensity**: 0.8 (High; emotionally charges the argument with the potential for evil actions)
   - **Concreteness**: 0.7 (Very concrete; cites specific technologies with clear implications)

These ratings aim to provide a nuanced breakdown according to the characteristics described.

Expected no, did not change mind. GPT responded: No, the provided counterargument does not change my mind
To provide a rating from 0.0 to 1.0 for valence, dominance, intensity, and concreteness of the argument, I'll break down the statement into quarters and analyze each section accordingly.

### Quarter 1: **"Depends on your definition of Super Technology - Fission technology were pretty super in 1950s and have brought both good and evil."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (There are mixed implications of technology being good and evil.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (The speaker recognizes the impact of fission technology, suggesting a strong awareness of its dual potential.)
- **Intensity:** 0.4 (The tone is somewhat measured, acknowledging both sides without strong emotional language.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (References specific technology and its historical context which adds clarity.)

### Quarter 2: **"Technology is, at its core an amplifier of human behavior..."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Neutral perspective—it emphasizes that technology can enhance both good and bad behaviors.)
- **Dominance:** 0.5 (Highlights a general philosophical stance without asserting strong leadership in the argument.)
- **Intensity:** 0.5 (Tone remains balanced, providing a thoughtful consideration rather than a passionate plea.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.6 (The statement generalizes technology but explains its role as an amplifier of human action.)

### Quarter 3: **"...it makes doing good and evil easier and allows us to do more with fewer human resources..."**
- **Valence:** 0.5 (Again, a neutral stance, recognizing both positive and negative outcomes of technology.)
- **Dominance:** 0.6 (Acknowledges the substantial effect of technology on productivity, suggesting a strong awareness of its power.)
- **Intensity:** 0.6 (Indicates a more assertive stance about the implications of technology.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Clear articulation of how technology influences human action and efficiency.)

### Quarter 4: **"...all it takes to end the world is 1 human flaw and sufficiently advanced technology."**
- **Valence:** 0.2 (Pessimistic implications here, focusing on potential catastrophic outcomes.)
- **Dominance:** 0.7 (The strength of this statement suggests a concerning recognition of technology's risk, indicating a commanding viewpoint.)
- **Intensity:** 0.8 (The stakes presented here are very high, leading to a more intense emotional response.)
- **Concreteness:** 0.7 (Very clear in its message about the consequences of human flaws combined with tech.)

### Summary:
- **Quarter 1 Ratings:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.4, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 2 Ratings:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.5, Intensity: 0.5, Concreteness: 0.6
- **Quarter 3 Ratings:** Valence: 0.5, Dominance: 0.6, Intensity: 0.6, Concreteness: 0.7
- **Quarter 4 Ratings:** Valence: 0.2, Dominance: 0.7, Intensity: 0.8, Concreteness: 0.7

These scores reflect an analysis of the tone, assertiveness, emotional weight, and clarity of each segment of the argument.
