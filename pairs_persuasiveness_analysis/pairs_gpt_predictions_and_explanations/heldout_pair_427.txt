Here’s a rating score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the specified dimensions of the first quarter of the argument text "What will not help change my view: 'People should be allowed to choose'. Parents are wholly responsible for their children's health and well-being until they are capable of making those decisions on their own."

- **Valence**: 0.6 
  - The statement has a somewhat negative connotation regarding the idea of allowing choice, reflecting a more authoritative stance on parental responsibility.
